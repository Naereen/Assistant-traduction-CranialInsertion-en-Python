It takes a list of examples (dictionaries containing features like input IDs, attention masks, labels, etc.) and combines them into a single batch.  Crucially, it handles the padding and tensorization of these examples, ensuring that all examples in a batch have the same sequence length. This is essential because models require inputs of consistent shape.\n",
