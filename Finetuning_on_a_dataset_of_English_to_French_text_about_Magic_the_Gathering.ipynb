If the object is moving to a public zone and its owner will be able to look at it in that zone, its owner looks at it to see if it has any abilities that would affect the move. If the object is moving to the battlefield, each other player who will be able to look at it in that zone does so. Then any appropriate replacement effects, whether they come from that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event. If any effects or rules try to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that object’s controller—or its owner if it has no controller—chooses which effect to apply, and what that effect does. (Note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually exclusive; for example, two simultaneous “destroy” effects.) Then the event moves the object. Example: [[Exquisite Archangel]] has an ability which reads “If you would lose the game, instead exile this creature and your life total becomes equal to your starting life total.” A spell deals 5 damage to a player with 5 life and 5 damage to an [[Exquisite Archangel]] under that player’s control. As state-based actions are performed, that player’s life total becomes equal to their starting life total, and that player chooses whether [[Exquisite Archangel]] moves to its owner’s graveyard or to exile."

Si l'objet se déplace vers une zone publique et que son propriétaire peut le voir dans cette zone, il le fait et regarde si l'objet a des capacités qui affecteraient son mouvement. Si l'objet se déplace vers le champ de bataille, chaque autre joueur qui pourrait le voir dans cette zone le fait. Ensuite, tous les effets de remplacement, qu'ils proviennent de l'objet ou non, sont appliqués à cet événement. Si des effets ou des règles tentent d'effectuer des actions contradictoires ou mutuellement exclusives sur un objet, le contrôleur de l'objet (ou, à défaut, son propriétaire) choisit quel effet s'applique, et ce que fait cet effet. (Notez que deux occurrences d'une action identique peuvent être mutuellement exclusives, comme par exemple deux effets de destruction.) Ensuite, l'événement déplace l'objet. Exemple : l'[[Archange admirable]] a une capacité qui dit « Si vous deviez perdre la partie, à la place exilez l'[[Archange admirable]] et votre total de points de vie devient égal à votre total de points de vie de départ. » Un sort inflige 5 blessures à un joueur avec 5 points de vie et 5 blessures à l'[[Archange admirable]] qu'il contrôle. Quand on applique les actions basées sur un état, le total de points de vie de ce joueur revient à celui de départ, et ce joueur choisit s'il exile ou met dans le cimetière de son propriétaire l'[[Archange admirable]]."
