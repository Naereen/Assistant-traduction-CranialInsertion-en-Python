        "# **Let's start to automate some translation task for Magic: the Gathering translation**\n",
        "\n",
        "> *A bit of context*: every weekend, a group of passionate and cool French judges work for about 1H30 (for free), on translating the newest article on the (awesome) ✨ [**Cranial Insertion** Magic: the Gathering blog](https://www.cranial-insertion.com/), from 🇺 English to 🇫 French.\n",
        "> I want to automate this task, as much as possible!\n",
        "> *Let's work more now, to work less in the future!*\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is what I would like to obtain: an entirely automated pipeline that takes care of helping us to produce the best translation of these English-written articles covering our favorite game (Magic!), in order to help us thanks to coding and AI, and which helps us be more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm thinking about these steps:\n",
        "1. when one of the North-American author submits their weekly article on Cranial Insertion, something should automatically trigger a script running \"on the cloud\" (a free/cheap \"Google Lambda function\" ?) or on the Cranial Insertion hosting server itself,\n",
        "2. this script should do [like I did last year](https://github.com/Naereen/Assistant-traduction-CranialInsertion-en-Python/blob/master/import-the-latest-article.ipynb), by connecting to the Cranial Insertion admin webpage and download the raw text of the newest article. Then it could be sent to the \"cloud\", into a new tab in our shared [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/), named by the date of the day.\n",
        "3. Ideally, this Google doc should be cut in three equally-spacen parts, each with a different color.\n",
        "4. Then, I want to also do [like I did last year in June](https://github.com/Naereen/Assistant-traduction-CranialInsertion-en-Python/blob/master/translate-card-names.ipynb), to translate as much as possible the names of the Magic cards when they are in tags like `[c]Card Name[/c]` or [c=Card Name]Card Name[/c]`.\n",
        "5. If possible, a free and efficient LLM specialized on translation from English to French, like HuggingFace's [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-fr](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-fr) model, could be used to suggest a first draft of a translation, paragraph by paragraph, to help us translate the article.\n",
        "6. Then when this is done and our shared Google doc has been updated to contain what should be read and translated, a message could be posted to our Discord server automatically, to notify the team of translator that the newest article is ready for translation! See <https://www.makerhacks.com/python-messages-discord/>, which requires a [Discord webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).\n",
        "   > If all this works fine, we could improve it by automatically affecting three out of the six translators, to a third of the article's content, and notifying only them in the message sent to Discord.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note:*\n",
        "- If running this task automatically can't be done easily, I can write a notebook that can run on Google colab or locally on my machine, and run it manually each week.\n",
        "- From Google colab, [it is (of course) possible to save a document to Google Drive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64808087/how-do-i-save-files-from-google-colab-to-google-drive#64810963), so it must be possible to edit a Google doc.\n",
        "\n",
        "> More links?\n",
        "> - See <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/translation> for the documentation I followed initially.\n",
        "> - See <https://github.com/Naereen/Assistant-traduction-CranialInsertion-en-Python> for the initial project I wrote (documentation in French) in June 2024."

For the cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men can not see. He is the soul of antique Ægyptus, and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in Meroë and Ophir. He is the kin of the jungle's lords, and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa. The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten.\n\nIn Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbors. Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight. But whatever the reason, this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel; and from some of the sounds heard after dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar. But the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard. In truth, much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of berating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees. When through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard after dark, the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by"

        "[a]As long as the \"toughness 40 or greater\" condition is met, sure. Both players on your opponents' team simultaneously lose half their life rounded up at the same time, and the game sees their shared life total for each player's life total. For example, if the team's life total is 30, each opponent loses 15 life and their team ends up at 0 life.

        "[a]Sure, as long as you can target a creature card with mana value 1 in your graveyard. To activate Sidisi's ability, you first choose some number for X; then you choose an appropriate target, which is a creature card with mana value X+1 in your graveyard; finally you pay the cost, which involves sacrificing a creature with mana value X other than Sidisi. X=0 is a legal choice for the ability, and a creature token has a mana value of 0 (usually, unless it's a copy of something that has a nonzero mana value). [/a]\n",

        "[a]Choosing to discard a card triggers a reflexive ability that requires a target, so you only choose a target after you discard. This means that you could target and bring back the card you just discarded, provided that it's a creature or land card, but this only benefits you if some triggered ability notices the card entering or leaving the graveyard. Otherwise, you achieve the same end result of the card being in your hand by simply choosing not to discard it in the first place.[/a]\n",

        "[a]That depends on how many creatures you control. The ability that defines Zurgo's Vanguard's power is a characteristic-defining ability that functions at all times and in all zones, including in your graveyard, so Zurgo's Vanguard's power is only small enough to be a legal target for the ability if you control at most two creatures.[/a]\n",

        "\n",
        "[a]Sure, that works. Call the Spirit Dragons's ability does not have an intervening-if clause that gets checked at the time the ability triggers. The ability goes on the stack regardless of how many Dragons you control, so you can make more Dragons in response to the ability.[/a]\n",

        "[a]Absolutely. As Effortless Master resolves, the replacement effect checks how many spells you've cast this turn, and you have cast two or more spells this turn, so the condition for Effortless Master to get counters is satisfied.[/a]\n",

        "\n",
        "[a]The game ends in a draw. The delayed triggered ability from New Way Forward's prevention effect deals damage to your opponent and causes you to draw a bunch of cards, and then state-based actions are checked. State-based actions see that your opponent is at 0 or less life and that you've attempted to draw from an empty library, so both of you lose the game at the same time and the game is a draw.[/a]\n",

        "\n",
        "[a]Yup! An ability that triggers when a counter is put on a permanent also triggers when a permanent enters with a counter on it. Also note that the ability would ordinarily trigger twice because Host of the Hereafter enters with two counters, but the ability is limited to triggering once each turn.[/a]\n",

        "\n",
        "[a]Thanks to Panharmonicon, there are two cards that fit the description of \"the exiled card\", and the ability simply performs its actions on both of those cards, so you'll make tapped and attacking token copies of both cards for each opponent.[/a]\n",

        "[a]You'll get a very similar situation as in the previous question. Mardu Siegebreaker exiles one creature, but it turns into several individual cards in exile. All of those cards are \"the exiled card\", so you'll make token copies of each of those cards for each opponent.[/a]\n",

Feel free to join us in either or both groups.\n\nIf you have any [b]Magic[/b] questions burning at the back of your brain, you can send them to us. We may even use them in a future article. If you have a short question, you can send it to us via our Twitter account at [url=https://twitter.com/CranialTweet]@CranialTweet[/url], and you can send us longer questions at [email]moko@cranialinsertion.com[/email].\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have two [c]Squire[/c]s on the battlefield and I have [c]Custodi Soulbinders[/c] and four copies of [c]Bear Cub[/c] in my graveyard. If I cast [c]Living Death[/c], how many +1/+1 counters will Soulbinders enter with?[/Q]\n\n[A] Custodi Soulbinders will enter with zero +1/+1 counters. Souldbinders and the Bears will enter simultaneously. Soulbinders' first ability is a replacement effect that checks to see how many creatures are on the battlefield just before it enters. At that point there are no creatures on the board, so it gets no counters as it enters.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My commander is [c]Grimgrin, Corpse-Born[/c]. Grimgrin was [c]Murder[/c]ed last turn and I choose to move him to the command zone. I control [c]Rooftop Storm[/c]. If I try to cast Grimgrin from the command zone, will he cost [m]2[/m] or will he be free?[/Q]\n\n[A] He will cost [m]2[/m]. \nCommander \"tax\" is an additional cost that must be paid in addition to the normal cost for casting your commander. Rooftop Storm gives you the option of replacing the normal cost of casting your Zombies with [m]0[/m]. This has no effect on additional costs.  [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent exiled [c]Wheel of Fate[/c] with [c]Reckless Impulse[/c]. She now claims she can cast Wheel of Fate because it's in exile. Is that true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. The part of suspend that lets you cast a card with no mana cost is casting it without paying its mana cost, not that it's casting it from exile.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I control four [c]Bear Cub[/c]s, [c]Agrus Kos, Eternal Soldier[/c], and [c]Thundering Raiju[/c]. None of my creatures are currently modified. I attack with the Raiju and have its attack trigger target Agrus. When Agrus's ability triggers because he became targeted, I pay the cost. After all these triggers resolve, how much damage will Raiju deal to each opponent?[/Q]\n\n[A] The Answer is between 15-19 damage, depending on when you let the trigger targeting Raiju resolve.\n\nWhen Agrus's trigger resolves, it creates five copies of Raiju's trigger, one for each Bear and one for Raiju, making a total of six Raiju triggers. The last trigger to resolve has to be the one targeting Agrus, and the other five resolve before it in the order of your choosing. \n\nFor our first example, we will have the trigger targeting Raiju resolve first, then the four triggers targeting Bears, and finally the one targeting Agrus.\n\nRaiju gets a +1/+1 counter, no damage is dealt as Raiju only checks modified creatures other than himself. Total damage 0.\nBear #1 gets a +1/+1 counter, 1 damage is dealt as there is only one modified creature other than Raiju. Total damage 1.\nBear #2 gets a +1/+1 counter, 2 damage is dealt as there are now two modified creatures. Total damage 3.\nBear #3 gets a +1/+1 counter, 3 damage is dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4 gets a counter, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage of 10.\nAgrus get a a counter, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage of 15.\n\nNow let's have the four Bears' triggers resolve first, then Raiju, followed by Agrus.\nBear #1, 1 damage is dealt. Total damage 1.\nBear #2, 2 damage is dealt. Total damage 3.\nBear #3, 3 damage id dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 10.\nRaiju, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 14.\nAgrus, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage is 19.\n\nThe later the trigger targeting Raiju resolves, the more the total damage.\n [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cleft=Grafdigger's Cage]Alex, the answer is \"What is used to \nkeep the dead from escaping their graves?\"[/cleft][Q] Does [c]Grafdigger's Cage[/c] stop [c]Abhorrent Oculus[/c] from manifest-dreading?[/Q]\n\n[A] Well, in the important ways, yes. They still \"manifest dread\", but some parts they can't complete. Manifest Dread is \"Look at the top two cards of your library. Manifest one of them, then put the cards you looked at that were not manifested this way into your graveyard.\" Since you can't put a creature from your library into play, both cards looked at are put into the graveyard.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Last turn my opponent stole my [c]Bear Cub[/c] by casting [c]Sower of Temptation[/c]. This turn I used [c]Ovinize[/c] to make the Sower lose all its abilities. I did this because I think I'll get my Bear Cub back, since the Sower no longer has the \"steal your creature\" ability. My opponent disagrees. Who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is correct. Removing the enters ability (that creates an effect with a duration) after the ability has resolved, doesn't stop it from functioning.\n\nIf it helps, an example that seems more intuitive would be the following: My opponent used [c]Rootwater Matriarch[/c] to steel my [c]Hill Giant[/c] enchanted with [c]Spirit Link[/c]. Killing the Matriarch won't get the Hill Giant back, even though that removes where the steal ability came from. The duration is based on whether or not the Hill Giant is still enchanted.\n\nSo with the original question, removing Sower's abilities doesn't stop the steal effect. You have to remove the Sower to gain the creature back because that ends the duration of the effect.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] So continuing with the last question, what if instead of [c]Ovinize[/c]ing the [c]Sower of Temptation[/c] I phased it out with [c]Reality Ripple[/c]?[/Q]\n\n[A] You would get your creature back. If a creature phases out, it's treated as though it's no longer on the battlefield. The duration of its effect has been met, so the effect ends and the stolen creature returns to its last controller, usually its owner.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I block my opponent's attacking [c]Bear Cub[/c] with [c]Manor Gargoyle[/c]. After combat ends, the opponent then casts [c]Disfigure[/c] targeting my Gargoyle. They claim they just killed my Gargoyle. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] It is not true, your Gargoyle lives through this. Many new players make this same wrong assumption. Damage doesn't reduce toughness. You have a 2/2 Gargoyle with 2 damage marked on it. Because it's indestructible, the state based action that tries to destroy it for having equal or more damage than it has toughness fails to do anything. If they want to get your Gargoyle into the graveyard, they need to give it enough [c=Dismember]-X/-X to make its toughness 0 or less[/c], or force you to [c=Diabolic Edict]sacrifice it[/c].[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If [c]Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer[/c] is my commander, can I cast him for his dash cost from the command zone?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. Dash can be used from any zone, so long as you are allowed to cast that card from that same zone normally. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Following up with the last question, do I have to pay commander tax if I dash out my commander?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you do. Suppose you cast Ragavan normally on turn one, then later he died and returned to the command zone. When you go to dash him he now costs [m]3[/m][m]R[/m] to dash. Then if he dies again and returns to the command zone, the next time you go to cast him he costs either [m]4[/m][m]R[/m] to cast normally or [m]5[/m][m]R[/m] to dash.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have eight cards in my hand. I go to my cleanup step and discard [c]Blazing Rootwalla[/c] to get down to maximum hand size. Can I cast the Rootwalla even though I'm in my cleanup step?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. During most cleanup steps, no players get priority. However, if an ability triggers during the cleanup step, or a state based action applies during a cleanup step, then the active player gains priority and may cast spells and activate abilities. \n\nThis is when you can cast the Rootwalla, as discarding it to madness puts a trigger on the stack.\n\nA normal priority pass will begin from here and until all players pass in succession with an empty stack, players may add new items to the stack when they have priority. Once all players pass with an empty stack, this cleanup step ends and a new one begins. If that new cleanup ends normally, then the game will move on to the next player's turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] While resolving [c]Burning Inquiry[/c] I discarded [c]Basking Rootwalla[/c] and two [c]Mountain[/c]s. My opponent controls a [c]Rest in Peace[/c]. My opponent claims I can't cast the Rootwalla for its Madness cost as it got exiled by Rest in Peace when I discarded it. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. You can cast your Rootwalla for its madness cost. The Rootwalla hasn't been exiled by Rest in Peace yet. This is because madness doesn't quite work the way most people think it does. If a card with madness gets discarded, it goes to exile instead of being put into its owner's graveyard. Then the next time a player would get priority, a trigger allowing its owner to cast it for its madness cost is put on the stack. When this trigger resolves, the owner may cast the card, but if they don't then the card is put into their graveyard. \n\nTo get back to the original question, Rest in Peace can only exile a discarded Madness card after the owner has decided not to cast it for madness and choses to let it go to the graveyard.\n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent pays [m]3[/m][m]U[/m] to gain level 2 on their [c]Stormchaser's Talent[/c]. Before it becomes level 2, I [c]Boomerang[/c] it to their hand. The opponent says they still get to return an instant or sorcery to their hand, I say they don't, who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] You are correct, they do not. Gaining a level is an ability that uses the stack and can be responded to. Stormchaser's level 2 ability is a trigger that triggers upon it becoming level 2 and happens only after it becomes level 2. If it's not on the battlefield when its level 2 ability resolves, there is no ability to trigger (nor a permanent to become level 2). [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cright=Bear Cub|PO2]Alex, the answer is \"What is another\nname for Ursine Child?\"[/cright][Q] I enchanted my opponent's [c]Bear Cub[/c] with my [c]Sigil of Sleep[/c]. If the Bear Cub goes unblocked attacking me, who chooses which creature I control gets returned to its owner's hand?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to choose as you control the Sigil of Sleep.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c] while I control [c]Anointed Procession[/c]. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] Both still get exiled. Saint Traft's triggered ability still made both tokens and tracks them to be exiled at the end of combat. Procession doesn't make tokens, it just changes how many tokens other cards and abilities make.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c], but before blocks, I cast [c]Eyes in the Skies[/c] choosing to populate the Angel token. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to keep the one made by Eyes in the Skies. Unlike Anointed Procession from the last question, Eyes in the Skies makes the token and the token has no link to the ability that made the original Angel token. This includes that the second Angel token is not attacking, is not tapped, and it won't get exiled at the end of combat.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I don't understand what [c]Emrakul, the World Anew[/c] has protection from. Can you clarify this?[/Q]\n\n[A] Emrakul has protection from spells and separately protection from permanents cast \"this turn\". This turn is whichever turn it currently is, even if it's been many turns since Emrakul herself was cast. \n\nSo for example, if I cast [c]Visara the Dreadful[/c] and gave her some [c]Lightning Greaves[/c] the same turn I cast her, she can't target and destroy Emrakul that turn. However, if I pass to my opponent's turn, Visara can now kill Emrakul as it's no longer the same turn Visara was cast. If I used [c]Goryo's Vengeance[/c] to reanimate Visara, then Visara could kill Emrakul that same turn as Visara wasn't cast at all.\n\nEmrakul's protection ability acts similar to having protection from Auras. Auras when cast target what they will enchant, so Emrakul is safe from most Auras. However, on later turns, an Aura could be moved from its original target, to enchant Emrakul. For example, you could move [c]Pacifism[/c] from a 1/1 Goblin token to Emrakul using [c]Crown of the Ages[/c]. \n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I cast [c]Season of Weaving[/c] choosing the two paws mode (to copy my [c]Arcanis the Omnipotent[/c]) and the three paws mode. Will I have to put one Arcanis into my graveyard due to the legend rule before bouncing all nonland and nontoken permanents?[/Q]\n\n[A] You will not and you can not. The legend rule is a state based action. It's never checked in the middle of resolving a spell. You will put the original Arcanis into your hand before Season of Weaving fully resolves. The legend rule doesn't come into play during this situation.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If I cast [c]Righteous Confluence[/c] choosing mode two once to exile my opponent's [c]Leyline of Sanctity[/c] and mode three twice to gain 10 total life, and the opponent responds by [c]Boomerang[/c]ing the Leyline back to their hand, do I still gain 10 life?[/Q]\n\n[A] You do not. Righteous Confluence had only one target, Leyline of Sanctity, and that target has disappeared. If a spell loses all of its targets by the time it goes to resolve, it fizzles and none of its effects happen. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I just cast [c]Cultivate[/c] putting a [c]Swamp[/c] onto the battlefield and a [c]Forest[/c] into my hand. I haven't played a land from my hand yet this turn. Can I still play the Forest as my land drop for the turn, or did the Swamp use up my land drop for the turn?[/Q]\n\n[A] You may still play the Forest. Putting a land onto the battlefield with a spell or ability doesn't use up your one land drop per turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n\nEach Question in my last article had a hidden reference to a different pop-culture pig.

Feel free to join us in either or both groups.\n\nIf you have any [b]Magic[/b] questions burning at the back of your brain, you can send them to us. We may even use them in a future article. If you have a short question, you can send it to us via our Twitter account at [url=https://twitter.com/CranialTweet]@CranialTweet[/url], and you can send us longer questions at [email]moko@cranialinsertion.com[/email].\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have two [c]Squire[/c]s on the battlefield and I have [c]Custodi Soulbinders[/c] and four copies of [c]Bear Cub[/c] in my graveyard. If I cast [c]Living Death[/c], how many +1/+1 counters will Soulbinders enter with?[/Q]\n\n[A] Custodi Soulbinders will enter with zero +1/+1 counters. Souldbinders and the Bears will enter simultaneously. Soulbinders' first ability is a replacement effect that checks to see how many creatures are on the battlefield just before it enters. At that point there are no creatures on the board, so it gets no counters as it enters.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My commander is [c]Grimgrin, Corpse-Born[/c]. Grimgrin was [c]Murder[/c]ed last turn and I choose to move him to the command zone. I control [c]Rooftop Storm[/c]. If I try to cast Grimgrin from the command zone, will he cost [m]2[/m] or will he be free?[/Q]\n\n[A] He will cost [m]2[/m]. \nCommander \"tax\" is an additional cost that must be paid in addition to the normal cost for casting your commander. Rooftop Storm gives you the option of replacing the normal cost of casting your Zombies with [m]0[/m]. This has no effect on additional costs.  [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent exiled [c]Wheel of Fate[/c] with [c]Reckless Impulse[/c]. She now claims she can cast Wheel of Fate because it's in exile. Is that true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. The part of suspend that lets you cast a card with no mana cost is casting it without paying its mana cost, not that it's casting it from exile.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I control four [c]Bear Cub[/c]s, [c]Agrus Kos, Eternal Soldier[/c], and [c]Thundering Raiju[/c]. None of my creatures are currently modified. I attack with the Raiju and have its attack trigger target Agrus. When Agrus's ability triggers because he became targeted, I pay the cost. After all these triggers resolve, how much damage will Raiju deal to each opponent?[/Q]\n\n[A] The Answer is between 15-19 damage, depending on when you let the trigger targeting Raiju resolve.\n\nWhen Agrus's trigger resolves, it creates five copies of Raiju's trigger, one for each Bear and one for Raiju, making a total of six Raiju triggers. The last trigger to resolve has to be the one targeting Agrus, and the other five resolve before it in the order of your choosing. \n\nFor our first example, we will have the trigger targeting Raiju resolve first, then the four triggers targeting Bears, and finally the one targeting Agrus.\n\nRaiju gets a +1/+1 counter, no damage is dealt as Raiju only checks modified creatures other than himself. Total damage 0.\nBear #1 gets a +1/+1 counter, 1 damage is dealt as there is only one modified creature other than Raiju. Total damage 1.\nBear #2 gets a +1/+1 counter, 2 damage is dealt as there are now two modified creatures. Total damage 3.\nBear #3 gets a +1/+1 counter, 3 damage is dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4 gets a counter, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage of 10.\nAgrus get a a counter, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage of 15.\n\nNow let's have the four Bears' triggers resolve first, then Raiju, followed by Agrus.\nBear #1, 1 damage is dealt. Total damage 1.\nBear #2, 2 damage is dealt. Total damage 3.\nBear #3, 3 damage id dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 10.\nRaiju, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 14.\nAgrus, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage is 19.\n\nThe later the trigger targeting Raiju resolves, the more the total damage.\n [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cleft=Grafdigger's Cage]Alex, the answer is \"What is used to \nkeep the dead from escaping their graves?\"[/cleft][Q] Does [c]Grafdigger's Cage[/c] stop [c]Abhorrent Oculus[/c] from manifest-dreading?[/Q]\n\n[A] Well, in the important ways, yes. They still \"manifest dread\", but some parts they can't complete. Manifest Dread is \"Look at the top two cards of your library. Manifest one of them, then put the cards you looked at that were not manifested this way into your graveyard.\" Since you can't put a creature from your library into play, both cards looked at are put into the graveyard.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Last turn my opponent stole my [c]Bear Cub[/c] by casting [c]Sower of Temptation[/c]. This turn I used [c]Ovinize[/c] to make the Sower lose all its abilities. I did this because I think I'll get my Bear Cub back, since the Sower no longer has the \"steal your creature\" ability. My opponent disagrees. Who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is correct. Removing the enters ability (that creates an effect with a duration) after the ability has resolved, doesn't stop it from functioning.\n\nIf it helps, an example that seems more intuitive would be the following: My opponent used [c]Rootwater Matriarch[/c] to steel my [c]Hill Giant[/c] enchanted with [c]Spirit Link[/c]. Killing the Matriarch won't get the Hill Giant back, even though that removes where the steal ability came from. The duration is based on whether or not the Hill Giant is still enchanted.\n\nSo with the original question, removing Sower's abilities doesn't stop the steal effect. You have to remove the Sower to gain the creature back because that ends the duration of the effect.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] So continuing with the last question, what if instead of [c]Ovinize[/c]ing the [c]Sower of Temptation[/c] I phased it out with [c]Reality Ripple[/c]?[/Q]\n\n[A] You would get your creature back. If a creature phases out, it's treated as though it's no longer on the battlefield. The duration of its effect has been met, so the effect ends and the stolen creature returns to its last controller, usually its owner.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I block my opponent's attacking [c]Bear Cub[/c] with [c]Manor Gargoyle[/c]. After combat ends, the opponent then casts [c]Disfigure[/c] targeting my Gargoyle. They claim they just killed my Gargoyle. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] It is not true, your Gargoyle lives through this. Many new players make this same wrong assumption. Damage doesn't reduce toughness. You have a 2/2 Gargoyle with 2 damage marked on it. Because it's indestructible, the state based action that tries to destroy it for having equal or more damage than it has toughness fails to do anything. If they want to get your Gargoyle into the graveyard, they need to give it enough [c=Dismember]-X/-X to make its toughness 0 or less[/c], or force you to [c=Diabolic Edict]sacrifice it[/c].[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If [c]Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer[/c] is my commander, can I cast him for his dash cost from the command zone?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. Dash can be used from any zone, so long as you are allowed to cast that card from that same zone normally. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Following up with the last question, do I have to pay commander tax if I dash out my commander?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you do. Suppose you cast Ragavan normally on turn one, then later he died and returned to the command zone. When you go to dash him he now costs [m]3[/m][m]R[/m] to dash. Then if he dies again and returns to the command zone, the next time you go to cast him he costs either [m]4[/m][m]R[/m] to cast normally or [m]5[/m][m]R[/m] to dash.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have eight cards in my hand. I go to my cleanup step and discard [c]Blazing Rootwalla[/c] to get down to maximum hand size. Can I cast the Rootwalla even though I'm in my cleanup step?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. During most cleanup steps, no players get priority. However, if an ability triggers during the cleanup step, or a state based action applies during a cleanup step, then the active player gains priority and may cast spells and activate abilities. \n\nThis is when you can cast the Rootwalla, as discarding it to madness puts a trigger on the stack.\n\nA normal priority pass will begin from here and until all players pass in succession with an empty stack, players may add new items to the stack when they have priority. Once all players pass with an empty stack, this cleanup step ends and a new one begins. If that new cleanup ends normally, then the game will move on to the next player's turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] While resolving [c]Burning Inquiry[/c] I discarded [c]Basking Rootwalla[/c] and two [c]Mountain[/c]s. My opponent controls a [c]Rest in Peace[/c]. My opponent claims I can't cast the Rootwalla for its Madness cost as it got exiled by Rest in Peace when I discarded it. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. You can cast your Rootwalla for its madness cost. The Rootwalla hasn't been exiled by Rest in Peace yet. This is because madness doesn't quite work the way most people think it does. If a card with madness gets discarded, it goes to exile instead of being put into its owner's graveyard. Then the next time a player would get priority, a trigger allowing its owner to cast it for its madness cost is put on the stack. When this trigger resolves, the owner may cast the card, but if they don't then the card is put into their graveyard. \n\nTo get back to the original question, Rest in Peace can only exile a discarded Madness card after the owner has decided not to cast it for madness and choses to let it go to the graveyard.\n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent pays [m]3[/m][m]U[/m] to gain level 2 on their [c]Stormchaser's Talent[/c]. Before it becomes level 2, I [c]Boomerang[/c] it to their hand. The opponent says they still get to return an instant or sorcery to their hand, I say they don't, who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] You are correct, they do not. Gaining a level is an ability that uses the stack and can be responded to. Stormchaser's level 2 ability is a trigger that triggers upon it becoming level 2 and happens only after it becomes level 2. If it's not on the battlefield when its level 2 ability resolves, there is no ability to trigger (nor a permanent to become level 2). [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cright=Bear Cub|PO2]Alex, the answer is \"What is another\nname for Ursine Child?\"[/cright][Q] I enchanted my opponent's [c]Bear Cub[/c] with my [c]Sigil of Sleep[/c]. If the Bear Cub goes unblocked attacking me, who chooses which creature I control gets returned to its owner's hand?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to choose as you control the Sigil of Sleep.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c] while I control [c]Anointed Procession[/c]. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] Both still get exiled. Saint Traft's triggered ability still made both tokens and tracks them to be exiled at the end of combat. Procession doesn't make tokens, it just changes how many tokens other cards and abilities make.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c], but before blocks, I cast [c]Eyes in the Skies[/c] choosing to populate the Angel token. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to keep the one made by Eyes in the Skies. Unlike Anointed Procession from the last question, Eyes in the Skies makes the token and the token has no link to the ability that made the original Angel token. This includes that the second Angel token is not attacking, is not tapped, and it won't get exiled at the end of combat.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I don't understand what [c]Emrakul, the World Anew[/c] has protection from. Can you clarify this?[/Q]\n\n[A] Emrakul has protection from spells and separately protection from permanents cast \"this turn\". This turn is whichever turn it currently is, even if it's been many turns since Emrakul herself was cast. \n\nSo for example, if I cast [c]Visara the Dreadful[/c] and gave her some [c]Lightning Greaves[/c] the same turn I cast her, she can't target and destroy Emrakul that turn. However, if I pass to my opponent's turn, Visara can now kill Emrakul as it's no longer the same turn Visara was cast. If I used [c]Goryo's Vengeance[/c] to reanimate Visara, then Visara could kill Emrakul that same turn as Visara wasn't cast at all.\n\nEmrakul's protection ability acts similar to having protection from Auras. Auras when cast target what they will enchant, so Emrakul is safe from most Auras. However, on later turns, an Aura could be moved from its original target, to enchant Emrakul. For example, you could move [c]Pacifism[/c] from a 1/1 Goblin token to Emrakul using [c]Crown of the Ages[/c]. \n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I cast [c]Season of Weaving[/c] choosing the two paws mode (to copy my [c]Arcanis the Omnipotent[/c]) and the three paws mode. Will I have to put one Arcanis into my graveyard due to the legend rule before bouncing all nonland and nontoken permanents?[/Q]\n\n[A] You will not and you can not. The legend rule is a state based action. It's never checked in the middle of resolving a spell. You will put the original Arcanis into your hand before Season of Weaving fully resolves. The legend rule doesn't come into play during this situation.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If I cast [c]Righteous Confluence[/c] choosing mode two once to exile my opponent's [c]Leyline of Sanctity[/c] and mode three twice to gain 10 total life, and the opponent responds by [c]Boomerang[/c]ing the Leyline back to their hand, do I still gain 10 life?[/Q]\n\n[A] You do not. Righteous Confluence had only one target, Leyline of Sanctity, and that target has disappeared. If a spell loses all of its targets by the time it goes to resolve, it fizzles and none of its effects happen. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I just cast [c]Cultivate[/c] putting a [c]Swamp[/c] onto the battlefield and a [c]Forest[/c] into my hand. I haven't played a land from my hand yet this turn. Can I still play the Forest as my land drop for the turn, or did the Swamp use up my land drop for the turn?[/Q]\n\n[A] You may still play the Forest. Putting a land onto the battlefield with a spell or ability doesn't use up your one land drop per turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n\nEach Question in my last article had a hidden reference to a different pop-culture pig.

Feel free to join us in either or both groups.\n\nIf you have any [b]Magic[/b] questions burning at the back of your brain, you can send them to us. We may even use them in a future article. If you have a short question, you can send it to us via our Twitter account at [url=https://twitter.com/CranialTweet]@CranialTweet[/url], and you can send us longer questions at [email]moko@cranialinsertion.com[/email].\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have two [c]Squire[/c]s on the battlefield and I have [c]Custodi Soulbinders[/c] and four copies of [c]Bear Cub[/c] in my graveyard. If I cast [c]Living Death[/c], how many +1/+1 counters will Soulbinders enter with?[/Q]\n\n[A] Custodi Soulbinders will enter with zero +1/+1 counters. Souldbinders and the Bears will enter simultaneously. Soulbinders' first ability is a replacement effect that checks to see how many creatures are on the battlefield just before it enters. At that point there are no creatures on the board, so it gets no counters as it enters.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My commander is [c]Grimgrin, Corpse-Born[/c]. Grimgrin was [c]Murder[/c]ed last turn and I choose to move him to the command zone. I control [c]Rooftop Storm[/c]. If I try to cast Grimgrin from the command zone, will he cost [m]2[/m] or will he be free?[/Q]\n\n[A] He will cost [m]2[/m]. \nCommander \"tax\" is an additional cost that must be paid in addition to the normal cost for casting your commander. Rooftop Storm gives you the option of replacing the normal cost of casting your Zombies with [m]0[/m]. This has no effect on additional costs.  [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent exiled [c]Wheel of Fate[/c] with [c]Reckless Impulse[/c]. She now claims she can cast Wheel of Fate because it's in exile. Is that true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. The part of suspend that lets you cast a card with no mana cost is casting it without paying its mana cost, not that it's casting it from exile.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I control four [c]Bear Cub[/c]s, [c]Agrus Kos, Eternal Soldier[/c], and [c]Thundering Raiju[/c]. None of my creatures are currently modified. I attack with the Raiju and have its attack trigger target Agrus. When Agrus's ability triggers because he became targeted, I pay the cost. After all these triggers resolve, how much damage will Raiju deal to each opponent?[/Q]\n\n[A] The Answer is between 15-19 damage, depending on when you let the trigger targeting Raiju resolve.\n\nWhen Agrus's trigger resolves, it creates five copies of Raiju's trigger, one for each Bear and one for Raiju, making a total of six Raiju triggers. The last trigger to resolve has to be the one targeting Agrus, and the other five resolve before it in the order of your choosing. \n\nFor our first example, we will have the trigger targeting Raiju resolve first, then the four triggers targeting Bears, and finally the one targeting Agrus.\n\nRaiju gets a +1/+1 counter, no damage is dealt as Raiju only checks modified creatures other than himself. Total damage 0.\nBear #1 gets a +1/+1 counter, 1 damage is dealt as there is only one modified creature other than Raiju. Total damage 1.\nBear #2 gets a +1/+1 counter, 2 damage is dealt as there are now two modified creatures. Total damage 3.\nBear #3 gets a +1/+1 counter, 3 damage is dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4 gets a counter, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage of 10.\nAgrus get a a counter, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage of 15.\n\nNow let's have the four Bears' triggers resolve first, then Raiju, followed by Agrus.\nBear #1, 1 damage is dealt. Total damage 1.\nBear #2, 2 damage is dealt. Total damage 3.\nBear #3, 3 damage id dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 10.\nRaiju, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 14.\nAgrus, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage is 19.\n\nThe later the trigger targeting Raiju resolves, the more the total damage.\n [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cleft=Grafdigger's Cage]Alex, the answer is \"What is used to \nkeep the dead from escaping their graves?\"[/cleft][Q] Does [c]Grafdigger's Cage[/c] stop [c]Abhorrent Oculus[/c] from manifest-dreading?[/Q]\n\n[A] Well, in the important ways, yes. They still \"manifest dread\", but some parts they can't complete. Manifest Dread is \"Look at the top two cards of your library. Manifest one of them, then put the cards you looked at that were not manifested this way into your graveyard.\" Since you can't put a creature from your library into play, both cards looked at are put into the graveyard.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Last turn my opponent stole my [c]Bear Cub[/c] by casting [c]Sower of Temptation[/c]. This turn I used [c]Ovinize[/c] to make the Sower lose all its abilities. I did this because I think I'll get my Bear Cub back, since the Sower no longer has the \"steal your creature\" ability. My opponent disagrees. Who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is correct. Removing the enters ability (that creates an effect with a duration) after the ability has resolved, doesn't stop it from functioning.\n\nIf it helps, an example that seems more intuitive would be the following: My opponent used [c]Rootwater Matriarch[/c] to steel my [c]Hill Giant[/c] enchanted with [c]Spirit Link[/c]. Killing the Matriarch won't get the Hill Giant back, even though that removes where the steal ability came from. The duration is based on whether or not the Hill Giant is still enchanted.\n\nSo with the original question, removing Sower's abilities doesn't stop the steal effect. You have to remove the Sower to gain the creature back because that ends the duration of the effect.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] So continuing with the last question, what if instead of [c]Ovinize[/c]ing the [c]Sower of Temptation[/c] I phased it out with [c]Reality Ripple[/c]?[/Q]\n\n[A] You would get your creature back. If a creature phases out, it's treated as though it's no longer on the battlefield. The duration of its effect has been met, so the effect ends and the stolen creature returns to its last controller, usually its owner.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I block my opponent's attacking [c]Bear Cub[/c] with [c]Manor Gargoyle[/c]. After combat ends, the opponent then casts [c]Disfigure[/c] targeting my Gargoyle. They claim they just killed my Gargoyle. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] It is not true, your Gargoyle lives through this. Many new players make this same wrong assumption. Damage doesn't reduce toughness. You have a 2/2 Gargoyle with 2 damage marked on it. Because it's indestructible, the state based action that tries to destroy it for having equal or more damage than it has toughness fails to do anything. If they want to get your Gargoyle into the graveyard, they need to give it enough [c=Dismember]-X/-X to make its toughness 0 or less[/c], or force you to [c=Diabolic Edict]sacrifice it[/c].[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If [c]Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer[/c] is my commander, can I cast him for his dash cost from the command zone?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. Dash can be used from any zone, so long as you are allowed to cast that card from that same zone normally. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Following up with the last question, do I have to pay commander tax if I dash out my commander?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you do. Suppose you cast Ragavan normally on turn one, then later he died and returned to the command zone. When you go to dash him he now costs [m]3[/m][m]R[/m] to dash. Then if he dies again and returns to the command zone, the next time you go to cast him he costs either [m]4[/m][m]R[/m] to cast normally or [m]5[/m][m]R[/m] to dash.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have eight cards in my hand. I go to my cleanup step and discard [c]Blazing Rootwalla[/c] to get down to maximum hand size. Can I cast the Rootwalla even though I'm in my cleanup step?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. During most cleanup steps, no players get priority. However, if an ability triggers during the cleanup step, or a state based action applies during a cleanup step, then the active player gains priority and may cast spells and activate abilities. \n\nThis is when you can cast the Rootwalla, as discarding it to madness puts a trigger on the stack.\n\nA normal priority pass will begin from here and until all players pass in succession with an empty stack, players may add new items to the stack when they have priority. Once all players pass with an empty stack, this cleanup step ends and a new one begins. If that new cleanup ends normally, then the game will move on to the next player's turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] While resolving [c]Burning Inquiry[/c] I discarded [c]Basking Rootwalla[/c] and two [c]Mountain[/c]s. My opponent controls a [c]Rest in Peace[/c]. My opponent claims I can't cast the Rootwalla for its Madness cost as it got exiled by Rest in Peace when I discarded it. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. You can cast your Rootwalla for its madness cost. The Rootwalla hasn't been exiled by Rest in Peace yet. This is because madness doesn't quite work the way most people think it does. If a card with madness gets discarded, it goes to exile instead of being put into its owner's graveyard. Then the next time a player would get priority, a trigger allowing its owner to cast it for its madness cost is put on the stack. When this trigger resolves, the owner may cast the card, but if they don't then the card is put into their graveyard. \n\nTo get back to the original question, Rest in Peace can only exile a discarded Madness card after the owner has decided not to cast it for madness and choses to let it go to the graveyard.\n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent pays [m]3[/m][m]U[/m] to gain level 2 on their [c]Stormchaser's Talent[/c]. Before it becomes level 2, I [c]Boomerang[/c] it to their hand. The opponent says they still get to return an instant or sorcery to their hand, I say they don't, who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] You are correct, they do not. Gaining a level is an ability that uses the stack and can be responded to. Stormchaser's level 2 ability is a trigger that triggers upon it becoming level 2 and happens only after it becomes level 2. If it's not on the battlefield when its level 2 ability resolves, there is no ability to trigger (nor a permanent to become level 2). [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cright=Bear Cub|PO2]Alex, the answer is \"What is another\nname for Ursine Child?\"[/cright][Q] I enchanted my opponent's [c]Bear Cub[/c] with my [c]Sigil of Sleep[/c]. If the Bear Cub goes unblocked attacking me, who chooses which creature I control gets returned to its owner's hand?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to choose as you control the Sigil of Sleep.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c] while I control [c]Anointed Procession[/c]. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] Both still get exiled. Saint Traft's triggered ability still made both tokens and tracks them to be exiled at the end of combat. Procession doesn't make tokens, it just changes how many tokens other cards and abilities make.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c], but before blocks, I cast [c]Eyes in the Skies[/c] choosing to populate the Angel token. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to keep the one made by Eyes in the Skies. Unlike Anointed Procession from the last question, Eyes in the Skies makes the token and the token has no link to the ability that made the original Angel token. This includes that the second Angel token is not attacking, is not tapped, and it won't get exiled at the end of combat.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I don't understand what [c]Emrakul, the World Anew[/c] has protection from. Can you clarify this?[/Q]\n\n[A] Emrakul has protection from spells and separately protection from permanents cast \"this turn\". This turn is whichever turn it currently is, even if it's been many turns since Emrakul herself was cast. \n\nSo for example, if I cast [c]Visara the Dreadful[/c] and gave her some [c]Lightning Greaves[/c] the same turn I cast her, she can't target and destroy Emrakul that turn. However, if I pass to my opponent's turn, Visara can now kill Emrakul as it's no longer the same turn Visara was cast. If I used [c]Goryo's Vengeance[/c] to reanimate Visara, then Visara could kill Emrakul that same turn as Visara wasn't cast at all.\n\nEmrakul's protection ability acts similar to having protection from Auras. Auras when cast target what they will enchant, so Emrakul is safe from most Auras. However, on later turns, an Aura could be moved from its original target, to enchant Emrakul. For example, you could move [c]Pacifism[/c] from a 1/1 Goblin token to Emrakul using [c]Crown of the Ages[/c]. \n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I cast [c]Season of Weaving[/c] choosing the two paws mode (to copy my [c]Arcanis the Omnipotent[/c]) and the three paws mode. Will I have to put one Arcanis into my graveyard due to the legend rule before bouncing all nonland and nontoken permanents?[/Q]\n\n[A] You will not and you can not. The legend rule is a state based action. It's never checked in the middle of resolving a spell. You will put the original Arcanis into your hand before Season of Weaving fully resolves. The legend rule doesn't come into play during this situation.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If I cast [c]Righteous Confluence[/c] choosing mode two once to exile my opponent's [c]Leyline of Sanctity[/c] and mode three twice to gain 10 total life, and the opponent responds by [c]Boomerang[/c]ing the Leyline back to their hand, do I still gain 10 life?[/Q]\n\n[A] You do not. Righteous Confluence had only one target, Leyline of Sanctity, and that target has disappeared. If a spell loses all of its targets by the time it goes to resolve, it fizzles and none of its effects happen. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I just cast [c]Cultivate[/c] putting a [c]Swamp[/c] onto the battlefield and a [c]Forest[/c] into my hand. I haven't played a land from my hand yet this turn. Can I still play the Forest as my land drop for the turn, or did the Swamp use up my land drop for the turn?[/Q]\n\n[A] You may still play the Forest. Putting a land onto the battlefield with a spell or ability doesn't use up your one land drop per turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n\nEach Question in my last article had a hidden reference to a different pop-culture pig.
