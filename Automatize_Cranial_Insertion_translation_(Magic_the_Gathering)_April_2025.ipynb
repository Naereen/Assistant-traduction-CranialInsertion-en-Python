        "# **Let's start to automate some translation task for Magic: the Gathering translation**\n",
        "\n",
        "> *A bit of context*: every weekend, a group of passionate and cool French judges work for about 1H30 (for free), on translating the newest article on the (awesome) ✨ [**Cranial Insertion** Magic: the Gathering blog](https://www.cranial-insertion.com/), from 🇺 English to 🇫 French.\n",
        "> I want to automate this task, as much as possible!\n",
        "> *Let's work more now, to work less in the future!*\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is what I would like to obtain: an entirely automated pipeline that takes care of helping us to produce the best translation of these English-written articles covering our favorite game (Magic!), in order to help us thanks to coding and AI, and which helps us be more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm thinking about these steps:\n",
        "1. when one of the North-American author submits their weekly article on Cranial Insertion, something should automatically trigger a script running \"on the cloud\" (a free/cheap \"Google Lambda function\" ?) or on the Cranial Insertion hosting server itself,\n",
        "2. this script should do [like I did last year](https://github.com/Naereen/Assistant-traduction-CranialInsertion-en-Python/blob/master/import-the-latest-article.ipynb), by connecting to the Cranial Insertion admin webpage and download the raw text of the newest article. Then it could be sent to the \"cloud\", into a new tab in our shared [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/), named by the date of the day.\n",
        "3. Ideally, this Google doc should be cut in three equally-spacen parts, each with a different color.\n",
        "4. Then, I want to also do [like I did last year in June](https://github.com/Naereen/Assistant-traduction-CranialInsertion-en-Python/blob/master/translate-card-names.ipynb), to translate as much as possible the names of the Magic cards when they are in tags like `[c]Card Name[/c]` or [c=Card Name]Card Name[/c]`.\n",
        "5. If possible, a free and efficient LLM specialized on translation from English to French, like HuggingFace's [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-fr](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-fr) model, could be used to suggest a first draft of a translation, paragraph by paragraph, to help us translate the article.\n",
        "6. Then when this is done and our shared Google doc has been updated to contain what should be read and translated, a message could be posted to our Discord server automatically, to notify the team of translator that the newest article is ready for translation! See <https://www.makerhacks.com/python-messages-discord/>, which requires a [Discord webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).\n",
        "   > If all this works fine, we could improve it by automatically affecting three out of the six translators, to a third of the article's content, and notifying only them in the message sent to Discord.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note:*\n",
        "- If running this task automatically can't be done easily, I can write a notebook that can run on Google colab or locally on my machine, and run it manually each week.\n",
        "- From Google colab, [it is (of course) possible to save a document to Google Drive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64808087/how-do-i-save-files-from-google-colab-to-google-drive#64810963), so it must be possible to edit a Google doc.\n",
        "\n",
        "> More links?\n",
        "> - See <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/translation> for the documentation I followed initially.\n",
        "> - See <https://github.com/Naereen/Assistant-traduction-CranialInsertion-en-Python> for the initial project I wrote (documentation in French) in June 2024."

            "text/markdown": "[cright=Dragonstorm Forecaster]Today's forecast:\nCloudy with a chance of Dragonstorms[/cright]Greetings and welcome back to another issue of Cranial Insertion! The prereleases for [i]Tarkir: Dragonstorm[/i] are in the books and the set is heading into stores this weekend, so it's time for our first look at the fearsome Dragons -- and I suppose some other creatures, too -- and the new mechanics in this set.\n\nAs always, if you have questions for us, whether they're about [i]Tarkir: Dragonstorm[/i] or [b]Magic[/b] cards from any other set, you can send your questions by email to [email]moko@cranialinsertion.com[/email], or send short questions on X to @CranialTweet. One of our authors will send you an answer, and your question may even appear in a future article.\n\nAnd now, without further ado, let us behold some questions about Dragons!\n\n[hr]\n[q]What counts as a Dragon for [c=Caustic Exhale]behold a Dragon[/c]?[/q]\n\n[a]Something is a Dragon if (and only if) it has the creature type Dragon on its type line, such as [c]Armament Dragon[/c] just to name one of many examples. Having artwork that looks like a Dragon doesn't count -- sorry, [c=Ugin, Eye of the Storms]Ugin[/c] -- and just having the word \"Dragon\" in the card name doesn't count, either -- sorry, [c]Sarkhan, Dragon Ascendant[/c].[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]If I choose a Dragon I control to behold for [c]Osseous Exhale[/c] and the Dragon gets destroyed in response, do I still gain 2 life?[/q]\n\n[a]Sure. Osseous Exhale only checks whether a Dragon was beheld at the time it was cast. It doesn't matter if the Dragon is still around at the time Osseous Exhale resolves, you gain 2 life either way.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]If [c]Poised Practitioner[/c] is the second spell I cast in a turn, does it get a +1/+1 counter?[/q]\n\n[a]No. Poised Practitioner needs to be on the battlefield at the time you cast the second spell in a turn for its ability to trigger. If it's the second spell you're casting, it's on the stack at the time you're casting it, so its ability doesn't trigger.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]If I control [c]Taigam, Master Opportunist[/c] and cast [c]Channeled Dragonfire[/c] as my second spell for the turn, do both the original and the copy resolve before Taigam suspends the original?[/q]\n\n[a]No. Taigam's ability goes on the stack above Channeled Dragonfire and resolves first. It makes a copy of Channeled Dragonfire, and then it exiles Channeled Dragonfire with four time counters on it. The copy resolves now-ish, and the suspended one will get a chance to resolve when its last time counter goes off, but the original Channeled Dragonfire won't resolve.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]I control [c]Taigam, Master Opportunist[/c] and the second spell I cast is the Omen spell [c=Stormshriek Feral // Flush Out]Flush Out[/c]. What happens?[/q]\n\n[a]Taigam's ability makes a copy of the spell, and it sees the copiable characteristics of Flush Out, so it puts a copy of Flush Out on the stack. Then it suspends the entire card, Dragon and Omen, with four time counters on it. The Flush Out copy resolves and does its discard+draw thing and then you shuffle it into the library, which means you simply shuffle your library because the copy is not represented by a physical card. Eventually, when the last time counter comes off of the suspended card, you get to cast it for free and you may choose to cast either the Dragon side or the Omen side of it.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]When do I have to announce the target for [c]Glacial Dragonhunt[/c]?[/q]\n\n[a]Glacial Dragonhunt as a spell doesn't have a target, so you don't announce a target at the time you cast it. If you choose to discard a card during its resolution and that card turns out to be a nonland card, this triggers a reflexive triggered ability that has a target, and you announce its target when you put that ability on the stack.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]Does [c]Bloodletter of Aclazotz[/c] double the value of X for [c]Kotis, the Fangkeeper[/c]'s triggered ability?[/q]\n\n[a]I'm afraid not. Bloodletter of Aclazotz causes your opponent to lose twice the amount of life due the damage that Kotis deals to them, but the X in Kotis's ability is the amount of damage it dealt, not the amount of life that was lost as a result of the damage.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[cleft=Breaching Dragonstorm|TDM|101]When the sky looks like that, RUN![/cleft][q]Speaking of [c]Kotis, the Fangkeeper[/c], what's the time frame for casting the exiled cards?[/q]\n\n[a]Since the ability doesn't specify a duration for the \"you may cast\" effect, it means [i]right now[/i], during the resolution of Kotis's triggered ability. Any cards that you choose not to cast at that time, or that you can't cast because they lack targets or other prerequisites to cast, simply stay in exile indefinitely and uselessly.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]In Two-Headed Giant, does the last part of [c]Betor, Kin to All[/c]'s ability just insta-kill my opposing team?[/q]\n\n[a]As long as the \"toughness 40 or greater\" condition is met, sure. Both players on your opponents' team simultaneously lose half their life rounded up at the same time, and the game sees their shared life total for each player's life total. For example, if the team's life total is 30, each opponent loses 15 life and their team ends up at 0 life. However, note that Betor only counts the total toughness of the creatures that you control individually. It does not consider the creatures your teammate controls.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]If I control [c]The Sibsig Ceremony[/c] and I cast some creature, can I sacrifice it to give [c]Unburied Earthcarver[/c] a counter in response to the Ceremony's trigger and still get a Zombie Cleric token? [/q]\n\n[a]Yes, you can do that. The Ceremony's triggered ability will try and fail to destroy the creature, but the creation of the Zombie Cleric token is not contingent on this destruction, so you still get the token.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]Can I sacrifice a creature token to [c]Sidisi, Regent of the Mire[/c]'s activated ability?[/q]\n\n[a]Sure, as long as you can target a creature card with mana value 1 in your graveyard. To activate Sidisi's ability, you first choose some number for X; then you choose an appropriate target, which is a creature card with mana value X+1 in your graveyard; finally you pay the cost, which involves sacrificing a creature with mana value X other than Sidisi. X=0 is a legal choice for the ability, and a creature token has a mana value of 0 (usually, unless it's a copy of something that has a nonzero mana value). [/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]After I draw cards with [c]Narset, Jeskai Waymaster[/c]'s ability, can I cast any of the cards I drew?[/q]\n\n[a]If they're instants or have flash, sure. Narset's ability triggers and resolves in your end step, and players get priority in the end step, so you get the opportunity to cast spells from among the cards you drew.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]For chapter III of [c]Awaken the Honored Dead[/c], when do I choose the target? Can I target the card I discarded?[/q]\n\n[a]Choosing to discard a card triggers a reflexive ability that requires a target, so you only choose a target after you discard. This means that you could target and bring back the card you just discarded, provided that it's a creature or land card, but this only benefits you if some triggered ability notices the card entering or leaving the graveyard. Otherwise, you achieve the same end result of the card being in your hand by simply choosing not to discard it in the first place.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]Can I target [c]Zurgo's Vanguard[/c] with [c]Smile at Death[/c]'s triggered ability?[/q]\n\n[a]That depends on how many creatures you control. The ability that defines Zurgo's Vanguard's power is a characteristic-defining ability that functions at all times and in all zones, including in your graveyard, so Zurgo's Vanguard's power is only small enough to be a legal target for the ability if you control at most two creatures.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[cright=Call the Spirit Dragons]Who you gonna call?[/cright][q]Does [c]Call the Spirit Dragons[/c]'s ability go on the stack even if I don't control a Dragon? In other words, could I respond to the trigger by casting a Dragon with flash and give it a +1/+1 counter with the ability?[/q]\n\n[a]Sure, that works. Call the Spirit Dragons's ability does not have an intervening-if clause that gets checked at the time the ability triggers. The ability goes on the stack regardless of how many Dragons you control, so you can make more Dragons in response to the ability.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]If [c]Effortless Master[/c] is the second spell I cast in a turn, does it get the +1/+1 counters?[/q]\n\n[a]Absolutely. As Effortless Master resolves, the replacement effect checks how many spells you've cast this turn, and you have cast two or more spells this turn, so the condition for Effortless Master to get counters is satisfied.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]If [c]New Way Forward[/c] deals an amount of damage that's lethal to my opponent but also causes me to draw more cards than I have left in my library, what happens?[/q]\n\n[a]The game ends in a draw. The delayed triggered ability from New Way Forward's prevention effect deals damage to your opponent and causes you to draw a bunch of cards, and then state-based actions are checked. State-based actions see that your opponent is at 0 or less life and that you've attempted to draw from an empty library, so both of you lose the game at the same time and the game is a draw.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]If I control [c]Hollowmurk Siege[/c] with Sultai chosen, do I draw a card when [c]Host of the Hereafter[/c] enters with counters on it?[/q]\n\n[a]Yup! An ability that triggers when a counter is put on a permanent also triggers when a permanent enters with a counter on it. Also note that the ability would ordinarily trigger twice because Host of the Hereafter enters with two counters, but the ability is limited to triggering once each turn.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]If [c]Mardu Siegebreaker[/c]'s ability triggers twice due to [c]Panharmonicon[/c] for example, what happens when its attack trigger resolves?[/q]\n\n[a]Thanks to Panharmonicon, there are two cards that fit the description of \"the exiled card\", and the ability simply performs its actions on both of those cards, so you'll make tapped and attacking token copies of both cards for each opponent.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n[q]What happens if [c]Mardu Siegebreaker[/c]'s ability exiles a [c=Cubwarden]mutate pile[/c]?[/q]\n\n[a]You'll get a very similar situation as in the previous question. Mardu Siegebreaker exiles one creature, but it turns into several individual cards in exile. All of those cards are \"the exiled card\", so you'll make token copies of each of those cards for each opponent.[/a]\n\n[hr]\n\nAnd that's all the time we have for today's episode. Thanks for reading, and until next time, watch out for stormy weather!\n\n- Carsten Haese\n"

It makes a copy of Channeled Dragonfire, and then it exiles Channeled Dragonfire with four time counters on it.

It makes a copy of Channeled Dragonfire, and then it exiles Channeled Dragonfire with four time counters on it.

Feel free to join us in either or both groups.\n\nIf you have any [b]Magic[/b] questions burning at the back of your brain, you can send them to us. We may even use them in a future article. If you have a short question, you can send it to us via our Twitter account at [url=https://twitter.com/CranialTweet]@CranialTweet[/url], and you can send us longer questions at [email]moko@cranialinsertion.com[/email].\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have two [c]Squire[/c]s on the battlefield and I have [c]Custodi Soulbinders[/c] and four copies of [c]Bear Cub[/c] in my graveyard. If I cast [c]Living Death[/c], how many +1/+1 counters will Soulbinders enter with?[/Q]\n\n[A] Custodi Soulbinders will enter with zero +1/+1 counters. Souldbinders and the Bears will enter simultaneously. Soulbinders' first ability is a replacement effect that checks to see how many creatures are on the battlefield just before it enters. At that point there are no creatures on the board, so it gets no counters as it enters.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My commander is [c]Grimgrin, Corpse-Born[/c]. Grimgrin was [c]Murder[/c]ed last turn and I choose to move him to the command zone. I control [c]Rooftop Storm[/c]. If I try to cast Grimgrin from the command zone, will he cost [m]2[/m] or will he be free?[/Q]\n\n[A] He will cost [m]2[/m]. \nCommander \"tax\" is an additional cost that must be paid in addition to the normal cost for casting your commander. Rooftop Storm gives you the option of replacing the normal cost of casting your Zombies with [m]0[/m]. This has no effect on additional costs.  [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent exiled [c]Wheel of Fate[/c] with [c]Reckless Impulse[/c]. She now claims she can cast Wheel of Fate because it's in exile. Is that true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. The part of suspend that lets you cast a card with no mana cost is casting it without paying its mana cost, not that it's casting it from exile.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I control four [c]Bear Cub[/c]s, [c]Agrus Kos, Eternal Soldier[/c], and [c]Thundering Raiju[/c]. None of my creatures are currently modified. I attack with the Raiju and have its attack trigger target Agrus. When Agrus's ability triggers because he became targeted, I pay the cost. After all these triggers resolve, how much damage will Raiju deal to each opponent?[/Q]\n\n[A] The Answer is between 15-19 damage, depending on when you let the trigger targeting Raiju resolve.\n\nWhen Agrus's trigger resolves, it creates five copies of Raiju's trigger, one for each Bear and one for Raiju, making a total of six Raiju triggers. The last trigger to resolve has to be the one targeting Agrus, and the other five resolve before it in the order of your choosing. \n\nFor our first example, we will have the trigger targeting Raiju resolve first, then the four triggers targeting Bears, and finally the one targeting Agrus.\n\nRaiju gets a +1/+1 counter, no damage is dealt as Raiju only checks modified creatures other than himself. Total damage 0.\nBear #1 gets a +1/+1 counter, 1 damage is dealt as there is only one modified creature other than Raiju. Total damage 1.\nBear #2 gets a +1/+1 counter, 2 damage is dealt as there are now two modified creatures. Total damage 3.\nBear #3 gets a +1/+1 counter, 3 damage is dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4 gets a counter, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage of 10.\nAgrus get a a counter, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage of 15.\n\nNow let's have the four Bears' triggers resolve first, then Raiju, followed by Agrus.\nBear #1, 1 damage is dealt. Total damage 1.\nBear #2, 2 damage is dealt. Total damage 3.\nBear #3, 3 damage id dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 10.\nRaiju, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 14.\nAgrus, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage is 19.\n\nThe later the trigger targeting Raiju resolves, the more the total damage.\n [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cleft=Grafdigger's Cage]Alex, the answer is \"What is used to \nkeep the dead from escaping their graves?\"[/cleft][Q] Does [c]Grafdigger's Cage[/c] stop [c]Abhorrent Oculus[/c] from manifest-dreading?[/Q]\n\n[A] Well, in the important ways, yes. They still \"manifest dread\", but some parts they can't complete. Manifest Dread is \"Look at the top two cards of your library. Manifest one of them, then put the cards you looked at that were not manifested this way into your graveyard.\" Since you can't put a creature from your library into play, both cards looked at are put into the graveyard.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Last turn my opponent stole my [c]Bear Cub[/c] by casting [c]Sower of Temptation[/c]. This turn I used [c]Ovinize[/c] to make the Sower lose all its abilities. I did this because I think I'll get my Bear Cub back, since the Sower no longer has the \"steal your creature\" ability. My opponent disagrees. Who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is correct. Removing the enters ability (that creates an effect with a duration) after the ability has resolved, doesn't stop it from functioning.\n\nIf it helps, an example that seems more intuitive would be the following: My opponent used [c]Rootwater Matriarch[/c] to steel my [c]Hill Giant[/c] enchanted with [c]Spirit Link[/c]. Killing the Matriarch won't get the Hill Giant back, even though that removes where the steal ability came from. The duration is based on whether or not the Hill Giant is still enchanted.\n\nSo with the original question, removing Sower's abilities doesn't stop the steal effect. You have to remove the Sower to gain the creature back because that ends the duration of the effect.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] So continuing with the last question, what if instead of [c]Ovinize[/c]ing the [c]Sower of Temptation[/c] I phased it out with [c]Reality Ripple[/c]?[/Q]\n\n[A] You would get your creature back. If a creature phases out, it's treated as though it's no longer on the battlefield. The duration of its effect has been met, so the effect ends and the stolen creature returns to its last controller, usually its owner.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I block my opponent's attacking [c]Bear Cub[/c] with [c]Manor Gargoyle[/c]. After combat ends, the opponent then casts [c]Disfigure[/c] targeting my Gargoyle. They claim they just killed my Gargoyle. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] It is not true, your Gargoyle lives through this. Many new players make this same wrong assumption. Damage doesn't reduce toughness. You have a 2/2 Gargoyle with 2 damage marked on it. Because it's indestructible, the state based action that tries to destroy it for having equal or more damage than it has toughness fails to do anything. If they want to get your Gargoyle into the graveyard, they need to give it enough [c=Dismember]-X/-X to make its toughness 0 or less[/c], or force you to [c=Diabolic Edict]sacrifice it[/c].[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If [c]Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer[/c] is my commander, can I cast him for his dash cost from the command zone?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. Dash can be used from any zone, so long as you are allowed to cast that card from that same zone normally. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Following up with the last question, do I have to pay commander tax if I dash out my commander?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you do. Suppose you cast Ragavan normally on turn one, then later he died and returned to the command zone. When you go to dash him he now costs [m]3[/m][m]R[/m] to dash. Then if he dies again and returns to the command zone, the next time you go to cast him he costs either [m]4[/m][m]R[/m] to cast normally or [m]5[/m][m]R[/m] to dash.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have eight cards in my hand. I go to my cleanup step and discard [c]Blazing Rootwalla[/c] to get down to maximum hand size. Can I cast the Rootwalla even though I'm in my cleanup step?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. During most cleanup steps, no players get priority. However, if an ability triggers during the cleanup step, or a state based action applies during a cleanup step, then the active player gains priority and may cast spells and activate abilities. \n\nThis is when you can cast the Rootwalla, as discarding it to madness puts a trigger on the stack.\n\nA normal priority pass will begin from here and until all players pass in succession with an empty stack, players may add new items to the stack when they have priority. Once all players pass with an empty stack, this cleanup step ends and a new one begins. If that new cleanup ends normally, then the game will move on to the next player's turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] While resolving [c]Burning Inquiry[/c] I discarded [c]Basking Rootwalla[/c] and two [c]Mountain[/c]s. My opponent controls a [c]Rest in Peace[/c]. My opponent claims I can't cast the Rootwalla for its Madness cost as it got exiled by Rest in Peace when I discarded it. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. You can cast your Rootwalla for its madness cost. The Rootwalla hasn't been exiled by Rest in Peace yet. This is because madness doesn't quite work the way most people think it does. If a card with madness gets discarded, it goes to exile instead of being put into its owner's graveyard. Then the next time a player would get priority, a trigger allowing its owner to cast it for its madness cost is put on the stack. When this trigger resolves, the owner may cast the card, but if they don't then the card is put into their graveyard. \n\nTo get back to the original question, Rest in Peace can only exile a discarded Madness card after the owner has decided not to cast it for madness and choses to let it go to the graveyard.\n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent pays [m]3[/m][m]U[/m] to gain level 2 on their [c]Stormchaser's Talent[/c]. Before it becomes level 2, I [c]Boomerang[/c] it to their hand. The opponent says they still get to return an instant or sorcery to their hand, I say they don't, who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] You are correct, they do not. Gaining a level is an ability that uses the stack and can be responded to. Stormchaser's level 2 ability is a trigger that triggers upon it becoming level 2 and happens only after it becomes level 2. If it's not on the battlefield when its level 2 ability resolves, there is no ability to trigger (nor a permanent to become level 2). [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cright=Bear Cub|PO2]Alex, the answer is \"What is another\nname for Ursine Child?\"[/cright][Q] I enchanted my opponent's [c]Bear Cub[/c] with my [c]Sigil of Sleep[/c]. If the Bear Cub goes unblocked attacking me, who chooses which creature I control gets returned to its owner's hand?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to choose as you control the Sigil of Sleep.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c] while I control [c]Anointed Procession[/c]. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] Both still get exiled. Saint Traft's triggered ability still made both tokens and tracks them to be exiled at the end of combat. Procession doesn't make tokens, it just changes how many tokens other cards and abilities make.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c], but before blocks, I cast [c]Eyes in the Skies[/c] choosing to populate the Angel token. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to keep the one made by Eyes in the Skies. Unlike Anointed Procession from the last question, Eyes in the Skies makes the token and the token has no link to the ability that made the original Angel token. This includes that the second Angel token is not attacking, is not tapped, and it won't get exiled at the end of combat.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I don't understand what [c]Emrakul, the World Anew[/c] has protection from. Can you clarify this?[/Q]\n\n[A] Emrakul has protection from spells and separately protection from permanents cast \"this turn\". This turn is whichever turn it currently is, even if it's been many turns since Emrakul herself was cast. \n\nSo for example, if I cast [c]Visara the Dreadful[/c] and gave her some [c]Lightning Greaves[/c] the same turn I cast her, she can't target and destroy Emrakul that turn. However, if I pass to my opponent's turn, Visara can now kill Emrakul as it's no longer the same turn Visara was cast. If I used [c]Goryo's Vengeance[/c] to reanimate Visara, then Visara could kill Emrakul that same turn as Visara wasn't cast at all.\n\nEmrakul's protection ability acts similar to having protection from Auras. Auras when cast target what they will enchant, so Emrakul is safe from most Auras. However, on later turns, an Aura could be moved from its original target, to enchant Emrakul. For example, you could move [c]Pacifism[/c] from a 1/1 Goblin token to Emrakul using [c]Crown of the Ages[/c]. \n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I cast [c]Season of Weaving[/c] choosing the two paws mode (to copy my [c]Arcanis the Omnipotent[/c]) and the three paws mode. Will I have to put one Arcanis into my graveyard due to the legend rule before bouncing all nonland and nontoken permanents?[/Q]\n\n[A] You will not and you can not. The legend rule is a state based action. It's never checked in the middle of resolving a spell. You will put the original Arcanis into your hand before Season of Weaving fully resolves. The legend rule doesn't come into play during this situation.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If I cast [c]Righteous Confluence[/c] choosing mode two once to exile my opponent's [c]Leyline of Sanctity[/c] and mode three twice to gain 10 total life, and the opponent responds by [c]Boomerang[/c]ing the Leyline back to their hand, do I still gain 10 life?[/Q]\n\n[A] You do not. Righteous Confluence had only one target, Leyline of Sanctity, and that target has disappeared. If a spell loses all of its targets by the time it goes to resolve, it fizzles and none of its effects happen. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I just cast [c]Cultivate[/c] putting a [c]Swamp[/c] onto the battlefield and a [c]Forest[/c] into my hand. I haven't played a land from my hand yet this turn. Can I still play the Forest as my land drop for the turn, or did the Swamp use up my land drop for the turn?[/Q]\n\n[A] You may still play the Forest. Putting a land onto the battlefield with a spell or ability doesn't use up your one land drop per turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n\nEach Question in my last article had a hidden reference to a different pop-culture pig. With ten different questions there were ten different pigs. The spoiler below has the answer key to those references.\n[spoiler]\nQuestion 1) Charlotte's Web - Wilbur the Pig and Charlotte the Spider\nQuestion 2) Jim Henson's Muppets - Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog, and Fozzie Bear.\nQuestion 3) The Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf\nQuestion 4) Angry Birds Video Game (Birds vs Pigs)\nQuestion 5) Looney Tunes - Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, and Daffy Duck\nQuestion 6) Babe the 1995 Movie - Babe the Pig, Sheep for Babe to herd, and Farmer Arthur Hoggett\nQuestion 7) Legend of Zelda - Link an Elf Warrior, Zelda an Elf Noble, and Ganon (pig form of Ganondorf)\nQuestion 8) The Lion King - Timon the Meerkat, Pumbaa the Warthog, and some Hyenas for them to fight.\nQuestion 9) Toy Story - Woody the Cowboy, Buzz the Spaceman, Rex the T-Rex, and Hamm the Piggy Bank.\nQuestion 10) Winnie the Pooh - Pooh the Bear, Tigger the Tiger, and Piglet the Pig.[/spoiler]\n\n- Justin Hovdenes AKA Hovey\nLevel 2 Magic Judge\nRapid City, SD"

Feel free to join us in either or both groups.\n\nIf you have any [b]Magic[/b] questions burning at the back of your brain, you can send them to us. We may even use them in a future article. If you have a short question, you can send it to us via our Twitter account at [url=https://twitter.com/CranialTweet]@CranialTweet[/url], and you can send us longer questions at [email]moko@cranialinsertion.com[/email].\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have two [c]Squire[/c]s on the battlefield and I have [c]Custodi Soulbinders[/c] and four copies of [c]Bear Cub[/c] in my graveyard. If I cast [c]Living Death[/c], how many +1/+1 counters will Soulbinders enter with?[/Q]\n\n[A] Custodi Soulbinders will enter with zero +1/+1 counters. Souldbinders and the Bears will enter simultaneously. Soulbinders' first ability is a replacement effect that checks to see how many creatures are on the battlefield just before it enters. At that point there are no creatures on the board, so it gets no counters as it enters.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My commander is [c]Grimgrin, Corpse-Born[/c]. Grimgrin was [c]Murder[/c]ed last turn and I choose to move him to the command zone. I control [c]Rooftop Storm[/c]. If I try to cast Grimgrin from the command zone, will he cost [m]2[/m] or will he be free?[/Q]\n\n[A] He will cost [m]2[/m]. \nCommander \"tax\" is an additional cost that must be paid in addition to the normal cost for casting your commander. Rooftop Storm gives you the option of replacing the normal cost of casting your Zombies with [m]0[/m]. This has no effect on additional costs.  [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent exiled [c]Wheel of Fate[/c] with [c]Reckless Impulse[/c]. She now claims she can cast Wheel of Fate because it's in exile. Is that true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. The part of suspend that lets you cast a card with no mana cost is casting it without paying its mana cost, not that it's casting it from exile.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I control four [c]Bear Cub[/c]s, [c]Agrus Kos, Eternal Soldier[/c], and [c]Thundering Raiju[/c]. None of my creatures are currently modified. I attack with the Raiju and have its attack trigger target Agrus. When Agrus's ability triggers because he became targeted, I pay the cost. After all these triggers resolve, how much damage will Raiju deal to each opponent?[/Q]\n\n[A] The Answer is between 15-19 damage, depending on when you let the trigger targeting Raiju resolve.\n\nWhen Agrus's trigger resolves, it creates five copies of Raiju's trigger, one for each Bear and one for Raiju, making a total of six Raiju triggers. The last trigger to resolve has to be the one targeting Agrus, and the other five resolve before it in the order of your choosing. \n\nFor our first example, we will have the trigger targeting Raiju resolve first, then the four triggers targeting Bears, and finally the one targeting Agrus.\n\nRaiju gets a +1/+1 counter, no damage is dealt as Raiju only checks modified creatures other than himself. Total damage 0.\nBear #1 gets a +1/+1 counter, 1 damage is dealt as there is only one modified creature other than Raiju. Total damage 1.\nBear #2 gets a +1/+1 counter, 2 damage is dealt as there are now two modified creatures. Total damage 3.\nBear #3 gets a +1/+1 counter, 3 damage is dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4 gets a counter, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage of 10.\nAgrus get a a counter, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage of 15.\n\nNow let's have the four Bears' triggers resolve first, then Raiju, followed by Agrus.\nBear #1, 1 damage is dealt. Total damage 1.\nBear #2, 2 damage is dealt. Total damage 3.\nBear #3, 3 damage id dealt. Total damage 6.\nBear #4, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 10.\nRaiju, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 14.\nAgrus, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage is 19.\n\nThe later the trigger targeting Raiju resolves, the more the total damage.\n [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cleft=Grafdigger's Cage]Alex, the answer is \"What is used to \nkeep the dead from escaping their graves?\"[/cleft][Q] Does [c]Grafdigger's Cage[/c] stop [c]Abhorrent Oculus[/c] from manifest-dreading?[/Q]\n\n[A] Well, in the important ways, yes. They still \"manifest dread\", but some parts they can't complete. Manifest Dread is \"Look at the top two cards of your library. Manifest one of them, then put the cards you looked at that were not manifested this way into your graveyard.\" Since you can't put a creature from your library into play, both cards looked at are put into the graveyard.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Last turn my opponent stole my [c]Bear Cub[/c] by casting [c]Sower of Temptation[/c]. This turn I used [c]Ovinize[/c] to make the Sower lose all its abilities. I did this because I think I'll get my Bear Cub back, since the Sower no longer has the \"steal your creature\" ability. My opponent disagrees. Who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is correct. Removing the enters ability (that creates an effect with a duration) after the ability has resolved, doesn't stop it from functioning.\n\nIf it helps, an example that seems more intuitive would be the following: My opponent used [c]Rootwater Matriarch[/c] to steel my [c]Hill Giant[/c] enchanted with [c]Spirit Link[/c]. Killing the Matriarch won't get the Hill Giant back, even though that removes where the steal ability came from. The duration is based on whether or not the Hill Giant is still enchanted.\n\nSo with the original question, removing Sower's abilities doesn't stop the steal effect. You have to remove the Sower to gain the creature back because that ends the duration of the effect.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] So continuing with the last question, what if instead of [c]Ovinize[/c]ing the [c]Sower of Temptation[/c] I phased it out with [c]Reality Ripple[/c]?[/Q]\n\n[A] You would get your creature back. If a creature phases out, it's treated as though it's no longer on the battlefield. The duration of its effect has been met, so the effect ends and the stolen creature returns to its last controller, usually its owner.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I block my opponent's attacking [c]Bear Cub[/c] with [c]Manor Gargoyle[/c]. After combat ends, the opponent then casts [c]Disfigure[/c] targeting my Gargoyle. They claim they just killed my Gargoyle. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] It is not true, your Gargoyle lives through this. Many new players make this same wrong assumption. Damage doesn't reduce toughness. You have a 2/2 Gargoyle with 2 damage marked on it. Because it's indestructible, the state based action that tries to destroy it for having equal or more damage than it has toughness fails to do anything. If they want to get your Gargoyle into the graveyard, they need to give it enough [c=Dismember]-X/-X to make its toughness 0 or less[/c], or force you to [c=Diabolic Edict]sacrifice it[/c].[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If [c]Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer[/c] is my commander, can I cast him for his dash cost from the command zone?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. Dash can be used from any zone, so long as you are allowed to cast that card from that same zone normally. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] Following up with the last question, do I have to pay commander tax if I dash out my commander?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you do. Suppose you cast Ragavan normally on turn one, then later he died and returned to the command zone. When you go to dash him he now costs [m]3[/m][m]R[/m] to dash. Then if he dies again and returns to the command zone, the next time you go to cast him he costs either [m]4[/m][m]R[/m] to cast normally or [m]5[/m][m]R[/m] to dash.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I have eight cards in my hand. I go to my cleanup step and discard [c]Blazing Rootwalla[/c] to get down to maximum hand size. Can I cast the Rootwalla even though I'm in my cleanup step?[/Q]\n\n[A] Yes, you can. During most cleanup steps, no players get priority. However, if an ability triggers during the cleanup step, or a state based action applies during a cleanup step, then the active player gains priority and may cast spells and activate abilities. \n\nThis is when you can cast the Rootwalla, as discarding it to madness puts a trigger on the stack.\n\nA normal priority pass will begin from here and until all players pass in succession with an empty stack, players may add new items to the stack when they have priority. Once all players pass with an empty stack, this cleanup step ends and a new one begins. If that new cleanup ends normally, then the game will move on to the next player's turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] While resolving [c]Burning Inquiry[/c] I discarded [c]Basking Rootwalla[/c] and two [c]Mountain[/c]s. My opponent controls a [c]Rest in Peace[/c]. My opponent claims I can't cast the Rootwalla for its Madness cost as it got exiled by Rest in Peace when I discarded it. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[A] Your opponent is wrong. You can cast your Rootwalla for its madness cost. The Rootwalla hasn't been exiled by Rest in Peace yet. This is because madness doesn't quite work the way most people think it does. If a card with madness gets discarded, it goes to exile instead of being put into its owner's graveyard. Then the next time a player would get priority, a trigger allowing its owner to cast it for its madness cost is put on the stack. When this trigger resolves, the owner may cast the card, but if they don't then the card is put into their graveyard. \n\nTo get back to the original question, Rest in Peace can only exile a discarded Madness card after the owner has decided not to cast it for madness and choses to let it go to the graveyard.\n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] My opponent pays [m]3[/m][m]U[/m] to gain level 2 on their [c]Stormchaser's Talent[/c]. Before it becomes level 2, I [c]Boomerang[/c] it to their hand. The opponent says they still get to return an instant or sorcery to their hand, I say they don't, who is right?[/Q]\n\n[A] You are correct, they do not. Gaining a level is an ability that uses the stack and can be responded to. Stormchaser's level 2 ability is a trigger that triggers upon it becoming level 2 and happens only after it becomes level 2. If it's not on the battlefield when its level 2 ability resolves, there is no ability to trigger (nor a permanent to become level 2). [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[cright=Bear Cub|PO2]Alex, the answer is \"What is another\nname for Ursine Child?\"[/cright][Q] I enchanted my opponent's [c]Bear Cub[/c] with my [c]Sigil of Sleep[/c]. If the Bear Cub goes unblocked attacking me, who chooses which creature I control gets returned to its owner's hand?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to choose as you control the Sigil of Sleep.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c] while I control [c]Anointed Procession[/c]. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] Both still get exiled. Saint Traft's triggered ability still made both tokens and tracks them to be exiled at the end of combat. Procession doesn't make tokens, it just changes how many tokens other cards and abilities make.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c], but before blocks, I cast [c]Eyes in the Skies[/c] choosing to populate the Angel token. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[A] You get to keep the one made by Eyes in the Skies. Unlike Anointed Procession from the last question, Eyes in the Skies makes the token and the token has no link to the ability that made the original Angel token. This includes that the second Angel token is not attacking, is not tapped, and it won't get exiled at the end of combat.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I don't understand what [c]Emrakul, the World Anew[/c] has protection from. Can you clarify this?[/Q]\n\n[A] Emrakul has protection from spells and separately protection from permanents cast \"this turn\". This turn is whichever turn it currently is, even if it's been many turns since Emrakul herself was cast. \n\nSo for example, if I cast [c]Visara the Dreadful[/c] and gave her some [c]Lightning Greaves[/c] the same turn I cast her, she can't target and destroy Emrakul that turn. However, if I pass to my opponent's turn, Visara can now kill Emrakul as it's no longer the same turn Visara was cast. If I used [c]Goryo's Vengeance[/c] to reanimate Visara, then Visara could kill Emrakul that same turn as Visara wasn't cast at all.\n\nEmrakul's protection ability acts similar to having protection from Auras. Auras when cast target what they will enchant, so Emrakul is safe from most Auras. However, on later turns, an Aura could be moved from its original target, to enchant Emrakul. For example, you could move [c]Pacifism[/c] from a 1/1 Goblin token to Emrakul using [c]Crown of the Ages[/c]. \n[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I cast [c]Season of Weaving[/c] choosing the two paws mode (to copy my [c]Arcanis the Omnipotent[/c]) and the three paws mode. Will I have to put one Arcanis into my graveyard due to the legend rule before bouncing all nonland and nontoken permanents?[/Q]\n\n[A] You will not and you can not. The legend rule is a state based action. It's never checked in the middle of resolving a spell. You will put the original Arcanis into your hand before Season of Weaving fully resolves. The legend rule doesn't come into play during this situation.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] If I cast [c]Righteous Confluence[/c] choosing mode two once to exile my opponent's [c]Leyline of Sanctity[/c] and mode three twice to gain 10 total life, and the opponent responds by [c]Boomerang[/c]ing the Leyline back to their hand, do I still gain 10 life?[/Q]\n\n[A] You do not. Righteous Confluence had only one target, Leyline of Sanctity, and that target has disappeared. If a spell loses all of its targets by the time it goes to resolve, it fizzles and none of its effects happen. [/A]\n\n[hr]\n[Q] I just cast [c]Cultivate[/c] putting a [c]Swamp[/c] onto the battlefield and a [c]Forest[/c] into my hand. I haven't played a land from my hand yet this turn. Can I still play the Forest as my land drop for the turn, or did the Swamp use up my land drop for the turn?[/Q]\n\n[A] You may still play the Forest. Putting a land onto the battlefield with a spell or ability doesn't use up your one land drop per turn.[/A]\n\n[hr]\n\nEach Question in my last article had a hidden reference to a different pop-culture pig. With ten different questions there were ten different pigs. The spoiler below has the answer key to those references.\n[spoiler]\nQuestion 1) Charlotte's Web - Wilbur the Pig and Charlotte the Spider\nQuestion 2) Jim Henson's Muppets - Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog, and Fozzie Bear.\nQuestion 3) The Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf\nQuestion 4) Angry Birds Video Game (Birds vs Pigs)\nQuestion 5) Looney Tunes - Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, and Daffy Duck\nQuestion 6) Babe the 1995 Movie - Babe the Pig, Sheep for Babe to herd, and Farmer Arthur Hoggett\nQuestion 7) Legend of Zelda - Link an Elf Warrior, Zelda an Elf Noble, and Ganon (pig form of Ganondorf)\nQuestion 8) The Lion King - Timon the Meerkat, Pumbaa the Warthog, and some Hyenas for them to fight.\nQuestion 9) Toy Story - Woody the Cowboy, Buzz the Spaceman, Rex the T-Rex, and Hamm the Piggy Bank.\nQuestion 10) Winnie the Pooh - Pooh the Bear, Tigger the Tiger, and Piglet the Pig.[/spoiler]\n\n- Justin Hovdenes AKA Hovey\nLevel 2 Magic Judge\nRapid City, SD"

Souldbinders and the Bears will enter simultaneously. Soulbinders' first ability is a replacement effect that checks to see how many creatures are on the battlefield just before it enters. At that point there are no creatures on the board, so it gets no counters as it enters.[/A]\n\n[A] Custodi Soulbinders entrera avec zéro marqueur +1/+1. Souldbinders et les Bears entreront simultanément. La première capacité de Soulbinders est un effet de remplacement qui vérifie le nombre de créatures sur le champ de bataille juste avant d'entrer. À ce moment-là, il n'y a pas de créatures sur le plateau, donc il ne reçoit pas de marqueurs lorsqu'il entre.[/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] My commander is [c]Grimgrin, Corpse-Born[/c]. Grimgrin was [c]Murder[/c]ed last turn and I choose to move him to the command zone. I control [c]Rooftop Storm[/c]. If I try to cast Grimgrin from the command zone, will he cost [m]2[/m] or will he be free?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Mon commandant est [c]Griggrin, Corpse-Born[/c]. Grimgrin a été [c]Murder[/c] dernier tour et je choisis de le déplacer dans la zone de commandement. Je contrôle [c]Rooftop Storm[/c]. Si j'essaie de lancer Grimgrin de la zone de commandement, va-t-il coûter [m]2[/m] ou sera-il libre?\n\n    [A] He will cost [m]2[/m]. \n    Commander \"tax\" is an additional cost that must be paid in addition to the normal cost for casting your commander. Rooftop Storm gives you the option of replacing the normal cost of casting your Zombies with [m]0[/m]. This has no effect on additional costs.  [/A]\n\n[A] Il vous en coûtera [m]2[/m]. Commander \"taxe\" est un coût supplémentaire qui doit être payé en plus du coût normal pour lancer votre commandant. Rooftop Storm vous donne la possibilité de remplacer le coût normal de lancer vos Zombies par [m]0[/m]. Cela n'a aucun effet sur les coûts supplémentaires. [/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] My opponent exiled [c]Wheel of Fate[/c] with [c]Reckless Impulse[/c]. She now claims she can cast Wheel of Fate because it's in exile.

Est-ce vrai?[/Q]\n\n    [A] Your opponent is wrong. The part of suspend that lets you cast a card with no mana cost is casting it without paying its mana cost, not that it's casting it from exile.[/A]\n\n[A] Votre adversaire a tort. La partie de suspension qui vous permet de lancer une carte sans coût de mana est de la lancer sans payer son coût de mana, pas qu'il la jette de l'exil.\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] I control four [c]Bear Cub[/c]s, [c]Agrus Kos, Eternal Soldier[/c], and [c]Thundering Raiju[/c]. None of my creatures are currently modified. I attack with the Raiju and have its attack trigger target Agrus. When Agrus's ability triggers because he became targeted, I pay the cost. After all these triggers resolve, how much damage will Raiju deal to each opponent?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Je contrôle quatre [c] Ours Cub[/c]s, [c]Agrus Kos, Eternal Soldier[/c] et [c]Thundering Raiju[/c].Aucune de mes créatures n'est actuellement modifiée.J'attaque avec le Raiju et ai sa cible de déclenchement d'attaque Agrus.Quand la capacité d'Agrus se déclenche parce qu'il a été ciblé, je paie le coût.Après que tous ces déclencheurs se soient résolus, combien de dégâts Raiju infligera-t-il à chaque adversaire?\n\n    [A] The Answer is between 15-19 damage, depending on when you let the trigger targeting Raiju resolve.\n\n[A] La réponse se situe entre 15 et 19 points de dégâts, selon le moment où vous laissez le déclencheur cibler la résolution de Raiju.\n\n    When Agrus's trigger resolves, it creates five copies of Raiju's trigger, one for each Bear and one for Raiju, making a total of six Raiju triggers. The last trigger to resolve has to be the one targeting Agrus, and the other five resolve before it in the order of your choosing. \n\nLorsque le déclencheur d'Agrus se résout, il crée cinq copies du déclencheur de Raiju, une pour chaque Ours et une pour Raiju, ce qui fait un total de six déclencheurs de Raiju. Le dernier déclencheur à résoudre doit être celui ciblant Agrus, et les cinq autres résolvent avant dans l'ordre de votre choix.\n\n    For our first example, we will have the trigger targeting Raiju resolve first, then the four triggers targeting Bears, and finally the one targeting Agrus.\n\nPour notre premier exemple, nous aurons le déclencheur ciblant la résolution de Raiju en premier, puis les quatre déclencheurs ciblant les ours, et enfin celui ciblant Agrus.\n\n    Raiju gets a +1/+1 counter, no damage is dealt as Raiju only checks modified creatures other than himself. Total damage 0.\n    Bear #1 gets a +1/+1 counter, 1 damage is dealt as there is only one modified creature other than Raiju. Total damage 1.\n    Bear #2 gets a +1/+1 counter, 2 damage is dealt as there are now two modified creatures. Total damage 3.\n    Bear #3 gets a +1/+1 counter, 3 damage is dealt. Total damage 6.\n    Bear #4 gets a counter, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage of 10.\n    Agrus get a a counter, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage of 15.\n\nRaiju obtient un marqueur +1/+1, aucun dégât n'est infligé car Raiju ne vérifie que les créatures modifiées autres que lui-même..Total des dégâts 0.Ours 1 obtient un marqueur +1/+1, 1 dégât est infligé car il n'y a qu'une seule créature modifiée autre que Raiju.Total des dégâts 1.Ours 2 obtient un marqueur +1/+1, 2 dégâts sont infligés car il y a maintenant deux créatures modifiées.Total des dégâts 3.Ours 3 obtient un marqueur +1/+1, 3 dégâts sont infligés.Total des dégâts 6.Ours 4 obtient un marqueur, 4 dégâts sont infligés.Dégâts totaux de 10.Agrus obtenir un compteur, 5 dégâts sont infligés.Total des dégâts de 15\n\n    Now let's have the four Bears' triggers resolve first, then Raiju, followed by Agrus.\n    Bear #1, 1 damage is dealt. Total damage 1.\n    Bear #2, 2 damage is dealt. Total damage 3.\n    Bear #3, 3 damage id dealt. Total damage 6.\n    Bear #4, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 10.\n    Raiju, 4 damage is dealt. Total damage is 14.\n    Agrus, 5 damage is dealt. Total damage is 19.\n\nMaintenant, faisons résoudre les déclencheurs des quatre ours en premier, puis Raiju, suivi d'Agrus..Ours 1, 1 dégâts est infligé.Total des dégâts 1.Ours 2, 2 dégâts sont infligés.Total des dégâts 3.Ours 3, 3 points de dégâts infligés.Total des dégâts 6.Ours 4, 4 points de dégâts sont infligés.Le total des dégâts est de 10.Raiju, 4 points de dégâts sont infligés.Le total des dégâts est de 14.Agrus, 5 points de dégâts sont infligés.Le total des dégâts est de 19\n\n    The later the trigger targeting Raiju resolves, the more the total damage.\n     [/A]\n\nPlus le déclencheur ciblant Raiju est tardif, plus les dégâts totaux sont importants. [/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [cleft=Grafdigger's Cage]Alex, the answer is \"What is used to \n    keep the dead from escaping their graves?\"[/cleft][Q] Does [c]Grafdigger's Cage[/c] stop [c]Abhorrent Oculus[/c] from manifest-dreading?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [cleftCage de Graffiteur]Alex, la réponse est \"Qu'est-ce qui est utilisé pour empêcher les morts de s'échapper de leurs tombes?\"[/cleft][Q] Est-ce que [c]Cage de Graffiteur[/c] empêche [c]Oculus odieux[/c] de manifest-dreading?[/Q]\n\n    [A] Well, in the important ways, yes. They still \"manifest dread\", but some parts they can't complete. Manifest Dread is \"Look at the top two cards of your library. Manifest one of them, then put the cards you looked at that were not manifested this way into your graveyard.\" Since you can't put a creature from your library into play, both cards looked at are put into the graveyard.[/A]\n\n[A] Eh bien, dans les moyens importants, oui.Ils \"manifestent encore de l'effroi\", mais certaines parties ne peuvent pas être complétées.Manifest Dread est \"Regardez les deux cartes du dessus de votre bibliothèque.Manifestez l'un d'eux, puis mettez les cartes que vous avez regardées qui n'ont pas été manifestées de cette façon dans votre cimetière..Puisque vous ne pouvez pas mettre en jeu une créature de votre bibliothèque, les deux cartes regardées sont mises dans le cimetière..[/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] Last turn my opponent stole my [c]Bear Cub[/c] by casting [c]Sower of Temptation[/c]. This turn I used [c]Ovinize[/c] to make the Sower lose all its abilities. I did this because I think I'll get my Bear Cub back, since the Sower no longer has the \"steal your creature\" ability. My opponent disagrees. Who is right?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Dernier tour, mon adversaire a volé mon [c]Bear Cub[/c] en lançant [c]Sower of Temptation[/c]. Ce tour, j'ai utilisé [c]Ovinize[/c] pour faire perdre au semeur toutes ses capacités. J'ai fait cela parce que je pense que je vais récupérer mon Bear Cub, puisque le semeur n'a plus la capacité \"voler votre créature\".\n\n    [A] Your opponent is correct. Removing the enters ability (that creates an effect with a duration) after the ability has resolved, doesn't stop it from functioning.\n\nRetirer la capacité d'entrée (qui crée un effet avec une durée) après que la capacité a été résolue, ne l'empêche pas de fonctionner.\n\n    If it helps, an example that seems more intuitive would be the following: My opponent used [c]Rootwater Matriarch[/c] to steel my [c]Hill Giant[/c] enchanted with [c]Spirit Link[/c]. Killing the Matriarch won't get the Hill Giant back, even though that removes where the steal ability came from. The duration is based on whether or not the Hill Giant is still enchanted.\n\nSi cela aide, un exemple qui semble plus intuitif serait le suivant : Mon adversaire a utilisé [c]Rootwater Matriarch[/c] pour renforcer mon [c]Hill Giant[/c] enchanté par [c]Spirit Link[/c].Tuer la Matriarche ne ramènera pas le Géant de la Colline, même si cela enlève l'endroit d'où venait la capacité de vol..La durée est basée sur le fait que le Géant de la Colline soit encore enchanté ou non.\n\n    So with the original question, removing Sower's abilities doesn't stop the steal effect. You have to remove the Sower to gain the creature back because that ends the duration of the effect.[/A]\n\nDonc, avec la question d'origine, retirer les capacités du Semeur n'arrête pas l'effet de vol. Vous devez retirer le Semeur pour récupérer la créature, car cela met fin à la durée de l'effet.\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] So continuing with the last question, what if instead of [c]Ovinize[/c]ing the [c]Sower of Temptation[/c] I phased it out with [c]Reality Ripple[/c]?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Donc, en continuant avec la dernière question, que se passerait-il si au lieu de [c]Ovinize[/c]le Semeur de Tentation[/c] je l'éliminais progressivement avec [c]Reality Ripple[/c]?[/Q]\n\n    [A] You would get your creature back. If a creature phases out, it's treated as though it's no longer on the battlefield. The duration of its effect has been met, so the effect ends and the stolen creature returns to its last controller, usually its owner.[/A]\n\n[A] Vous récupéreriez votre créature. Si une créature sort progressivement, elle est traitée comme si elle n'était plus sur le champ de bataille. La durée de son effet a été atteinte, de sorte que l'effet se termine et que la créature volée retourne à son dernier contrôleur, généralement son propriétaire.[/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] I block my opponent's attacking [c]Bear Cub[/c] with [c]Manor Gargoyle[/c]. After combat ends, the opponent then casts [c]Disfigure[/c] targeting my Gargoyle. They claim they just killed my Gargoyle. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Je bloque l'attaque de mon adversaire [c]Bear Cub[/c] avec [c]Manor Gargoyle[/c]. Après la fin du combat, l'adversaire lance alors [c]Défigure[/c] ciblant ma Gargouille. Ils prétendent qu'ils viennent de tuer ma Gargoyle. Est-ce vrai?[/Q]\n\n    [A] It is not true, your Gargoyle lives through this. Many new players make this same wrong assumption. Damage doesn't reduce toughness. You have a 2/2 Gargoyle with 2 damage marked on it. Because it's indestructible, the state based action that tries to destroy it for having equal or more damage than it has toughness fails to do anything. If they want to get your Gargoyle into the graveyard, they need to give it enough [c=Dismember]-X/-X to make its toughness 0 or less[/c], or force you to [c=Diabolic Edict]sacrifice it[/c].[/A]\n\n[A] Ce n'est pas vrai, votre Gargoyle vit à travers cette.Beaucoup de nouveaux joueurs font la même hypothèse erronée.Les dommages ne réduisent pas la ténacité.Vous avez une gargouille 2/2 avec 2 dégâts marqués dessus.Parce qu'il est indestructible, l'action basée sur l'état qui tente de le détruire pour avoir des dégâts égaux ou plus qu'il n'a la dureté ne parvient pas à faire quoi que ce soit..S'ils veulent faire entrer votre Gargouille dans le cimetière, ils doivent lui donner assez de [cDismember]-X/-X pour rendre son endurance 0 ou moins[/c], ou vous forcer à [cDiabolic Edict]sacrifice it[/c].[/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] If [c]Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer[/c] is my commander, can I cast him for his dash cost from the command zone?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Si [c]Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer[/c] est mon commandant, puis-je le jeter pour son coût de tableau de bord de la zone de commande?[/Q]\n\n    [A] Yes, you can. Dash can be used from any zone, so long as you are allowed to cast that card from that same zone normally. [/A]\n\n[A] Oui, vous pouvez. Dash peut être utilisé à partir de n'importe quelle zone, tant que vous êtes autorisé à lancer cette carte à partir de la même zone normalement. [/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] Following up with the last question, do I have to pay commander tax if I dash out my commander?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Suite à la dernière question, dois-je payer la taxe de commandant si je me précipite hors de mon commandant?[/Q]\n\n    [A] Yes, you do. Suppose you cast Ragavan normally on turn one, then later he died and returned to the command zone. When you go to dash him he now costs [m]3[/m][m]R[/m] to dash. Then if he dies again and returns to the command zone, the next time you go to cast him he costs either [m]4[/m][m]R[/m] to cast normally or [m]5[/m][m]R[/m] to dash.[/A]\n\n[A] Oui, vous le faites. Supposons que vous lancez Ragavan normalement au premier tour, puis plus tard il est mort et est retourné à la zone de commande. Lorsque vous allez le lancer, il coûte maintenant [m] 3 [/m] [m] R [/m] à lancer. Puis s'il meurt à nouveau et retourne à la zone de commande, la prochaine fois que vous allez le lancer, il coûte soit [m] 4 [/m] R [/m]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] I have eight cards in my hand. I go to my cleanup step and discard [c]Blazing Rootwalla[/c] to get down to maximum hand size. Can I cast the Rootwalla even though I'm in my cleanup step?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] J'ai huit cartes dans ma main. Je vais à mon étape de nettoyage et je jette [c]Blazing Rootwalla[/c] pour descendre à la taille maximale de la main. Puis-je lancer le Rootwalla même si je suis dans mon étape de nettoyage?[/Q]\n\n    [A] Yes, you can. During most cleanup steps, no players get priority. However, if an ability triggers during the cleanup step, or a state based action applies during a cleanup step, then the active player gains priority and may cast spells and activate abilities. \n\n[A] Oui, vous pouvez. Pendant la plupart des étapes de nettoyage, aucun joueur n'obtient la priorité. Cependant, si une capacité se déclenche pendant l'étape de nettoyage, ou si une action basée sur l'état s'applique pendant une étape de nettoyage, alors le joueur actif gagne en priorité et peut lancer des sorts et activer des capacités.\n\n    This is when you can cast the Rootwalla, as discarding it to madness puts a trigger on the stack.\n\nC'est à ce moment-là que vous pouvez lancer le Rootwalla, car le jeter à la folie met un déclencheur sur la pile.\n\n    A normal priority pass will begin from here and until all players pass in succession with an empty stack, players may add new items to the stack when they have priority. Once all players pass with an empty stack, this cleanup step ends and a new one begins. If that new cleanup ends normally, then the game will move on to the next player's turn.[/A]\n\nUne passe de priorité normale commencera à partir d'ici et jusqu'à ce que tous les joueurs passent successivement avec une pile vide, les joueurs peuvent ajouter de nouveaux objets à la pile quand ils ont la priorité. Une fois que tous les joueurs passent avec une pile vide, cette étape de nettoyage se termine et une nouvelle commence. Si ce nouveau nettoyage se termine normalement, alors la partie passera au tour du joueur suivant.\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] While resolving [c]Burning Inquiry[/c] I discarded [c]Basking Rootwalla[/c] and two [c]Mountain[/c]s. My opponent controls a [c]Rest in Peace[/c]. My opponent claims I can't cast the Rootwalla for its Madness cost as it got exiled by Rest in Peace when I discarded it. Is this true?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Mon adversaire contrôle un [c]Repos en paix[/c]. Mon adversaire prétend que je ne peux pas lancer le Rootwalla pour son coût de folie car il a été exilé par Rest in Peace quand je l'ai rejeté. Est-ce vrai?\n\n    [A] Your opponent is wrong. You can cast your Rootwalla for its madness cost. The Rootwalla hasn't been exiled by Rest in Peace yet. This is because madness doesn't quite work the way most people think it does. If a card with madness gets discarded, it goes to exile instead of being put into its owner's graveyard. Then the next time a player would get priority, a trigger allowing its owner to cast it for its madness cost is put on the stack. When this trigger resolves, the owner may cast the card, but if they don't then the card is put into their graveyard. \n\n[A] Votre adversaire a tort.Vous pouvez lancer votre Rootwalla pour son coût de folie.Le Rootwalla n'a pas encore été exilé par Rest in Peace.C'est parce que la folie ne fonctionne pas comme la plupart des gens pensent qu'elle fonctionne..Si une carte avec la folie est rejetée, elle va à l'exil au lieu d'être mise dans le cimetière de son propriétaire.Ensuite, la prochaine fois qu'un joueur obtiendra la priorité, un déclencheur permettant à son propriétaire de le lancer pour son coût de folie est mis sur la pile..Lorsque ce déclencheur est résolu, le propriétaire peut lancer la carte, mais s'il ne le fait pas, la carte est placée dans son cimetière..(suite)\n\n    To get back to the original question, Rest in Peace can only exile a discarded Madness card after the owner has decided not to cast it for madness and choses to let it go to the graveyard.\n    [/A]\n\nPour revenir à la question initiale, Rest in Peace ne peut exiler une carte Madness abandonnée que lorsque le propriétaire a décidé de ne pas la lancer pour la folie et a choisi de la laisser aller au cimetière.\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] My opponent pays [m]3[/m][m]U[/m] to gain level 2 on their [c]Stormchaser's Talent[/c]. Before it becomes level 2, I [c]Boomerang[/c] it to their hand. The opponent says they still get to return an instant or sorcery to their hand, I say they don't, who is right?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Mon adversaire paie [m]3[/m][m]U[/m] pour gagner le niveau 2 sur son Talent [/c]Stormchaser[/c]. Avant qu'il ne devienne le niveau 2, je [c] Boomerang[/c] à leur main. L'adversaire dit qu'il peut toujours retourner un instant ou de la sorcellerie à leur main, je dis qu'ils ne le font pas, qui a raison?[/Q]\n\n    [A] You are correct, they do not. Gaining a level is an ability that uses the stack and can be responded to. Stormchaser's level 2 ability is a trigger that triggers upon it becoming level 2 and happens only after it becomes level 2. If it's not on the battlefield when its level 2 ability resolves, there is no ability to trigger (nor a permanent to become level 2). [/A]\n\nTu as raison, ils n'ont pas.Gagner un niveau est une capacité qui utilise la pile et à laquelle on peut répondre..La capacité de niveau 2 de Stormchaser est un déclencheur qui se déclenche lorsqu'il devient de niveau 2 et n'arrive qu'après qu'il devienne de niveau 2..S'il n'est pas sur le champ de bataille lorsque sa capacité de niveau 2 est résolue, il n'y a pas de capacité de déclenchement (ni de permanent pour devenir niveau 2)..[/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [cright=Bear Cub|PO2]Alex, the answer is \"What is another\n    name for Ursine Child?\"[/cright][Q] I enchanted my opponent's [c]Bear Cub[/c] with my [c]Sigil of Sleep[/c]. If the Bear Cub goes unblocked attacking me, who chooses which creature I control gets returned to its owner's hand?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [crightBear CubPO2]Alex, la réponse est \"Quel est un autre nom pour Ursine Child ?\"[/cright][Q] J'ai enchanté le [c]Bear Cub[/c] de mon adversaire avec mon [c]Sigil of Sleep[/c].\n\n    [A] You get to choose as you control the Sigil of Sleep.[/A]\n\n[A] Vous pouvez choisir en contrôlant le Sigil of Sleep.[/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c] while I control [c]Anointed Procession[/c]. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] J'attaque avec [c]Geist de Saint Traft[/c] pendant que je contrôle [c]Procession ointe[/c]. Quand le combat se termine, les deux jetons Ange seront-ils exilés ou est-ce que je peux en garder un ?[/Q]\n\n    [A] Both still get exiled. Saint Traft's triggered ability still made both tokens and tracks them to be exiled at the end of combat. Procession doesn't make tokens, it just changes how many tokens other cards and abilities make.[/A]\n\n[A] Les deux sont toujours exilés. La capacité déclenchée de Saint Traft a toujours fait les deux jetons et les suit pour être exilés à la fin du combat. La procession ne fait pas de jetons, elle change simplement le nombre de jetons que font les autres cartes et capacités.[/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] I attack with [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c], but before blocks, I cast [c]Eyes in the Skies[/c] choosing to populate the Angel token. When combat ends, will both Angel tokens get exiled or do I get to keep one?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] J'attaque avec [c]Geist of Saint Traft[/c], mais avant les blocs, je lance [c]Eyes in the Skies[/c] en choisissant de remplir le jeton Angel. Quand le combat se termine, est-ce que les deux jetons Angel seront exilés ou est-ce que je peux en garder un?[/Q]\n\n    [A] You get to keep the one made by Eyes in the Skies. Unlike Anointed Procession from the last question, Eyes in the Skies makes the token and the token has no link to the ability that made the original Angel token. This includes that the second Angel token is not attacking, is not tapped, and it won't get exiled at the end of combat.[/A]\n\n[A] Vous obtenez de garder celui fait par les yeux dans les cieux. Contrairement à la procession ointe de la dernière question, les yeux dans les cieux fait le jeton et le jeton n'a aucun lien avec la capacité qui a fait le jeton Ange original. Cela inclut que le deuxième jeton Ange n'attaque pas, n'est pas tapoté, et il ne sera pas exilé à la fin du combat.\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] I don't understand what [c]Emrakul, the World Anew[/c] has protection from. Can you clarify this?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Je ne comprends pas de quoi [c]Emrakul, le Monde Anew[/c] est protégé. Pouvez-vous clarifier cela?[/Q]\n\n    [A] Emrakul has protection from spells and separately protection from permanents cast \"this turn\". This turn is whichever turn it currently is, even if it's been many turns since Emrakul herself was cast. \n\n[A] Emrakul a une protection contre les sorts et une protection séparée contre les permanents lancés \"ce tour\". Ce tour est celui qu'il est actuellement, même si cela fait plusieurs tours depuis qu'Emrakul elle-même a été lancée.\n\n    So for example, if I cast [c]Visara the Dreadful[/c] and gave her some [c]Lightning Greaves[/c] the same turn I cast her, she can't target and destroy Emrakul that turn. However, if I pass to my opponent's turn, Visara can now kill Emrakul as it's no longer the same turn Visara was cast. If I used [c]Goryo's Vengeance[/c] to reanimate Visara, then Visara could kill Emrakul that same turn as Visara wasn't cast at all.\n\nAinsi, par exemple, si je lance [c]Visara l'Effroyable [/c] et lui donne quelques [c]Lightning Greaves [/c] le même tour que je la lance, elle ne peut pas cibler et détruire Emrakul qui tourne.Cependant, si je passe au tour de mon adversaire, Visara peut maintenant tuer Emrakul car ce n'est plus le même tour que Visara a été jeté..Si j'utilisais [c]Goryo's Vengeance[/c] pour réanimer Visara, alors Visara pourrait tuer Emrakul le même tour que Visara.\n\n    Emrakul's protection ability acts similar to having protection from Auras. Auras when cast target what they will enchant, so Emrakul is safe from most Auras. However, on later turns, an Aura could be moved from its original target, to enchant Emrakul. For example, you could move [c]Pacifism[/c] from a 1/1 Goblin token to Emrakul using [c]Crown of the Ages[/c]. \n    [/A]\n\nLa capacité de protection d'Emrakul est similaire à celle d'une protection contre les auras.Les auras quand elles sont lancées ciblent ce qu'elles enchanteront, donc Emrakul est à l'abri de la plupart des auras..Cependant, plus tard, une aura pourrait être déplacée de sa cible d'origine, pour enchanter Emrakul..Par exemple, vous pouvez déplacer [c]Pacifisme[/c] d'un jeton 1/1 Gobelin à Emrakul en utilisant [c]Couronne des âges[/c].[/A]\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] I cast [c]Season of Weaving[/c] choosing the two paws mode (to copy my [c]Arcanis the Omnipotent[/c]) and the three paws mode. Will I have to put one Arcanis into my graveyard due to the legend rule before bouncing all nonland and nontoken permanents?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Je lance [c]Season of Weaving[/c] en choisissant le mode à deux pattes (pour copier mon [c]Arcanis l'Omnipotent[/c]) et le mode à trois pattes. Devrai-je mettre un Arcanis dans mon cimetière en raison de la règle de légende avant de rebondir tous les permanents non terrestres et non symboliques?[/Q]\n\n    [A] You will not and you can not. The legend rule is a state based action. It's never checked in the middle of resolving a spell. You will put the original Arcanis into your hand before Season of Weaving fully resolves. The legend rule doesn't come into play during this situation.[/A]\n\n[A] Vous ne le ferez pas et vous ne pouvez pas. La règle de la légende est une action basée sur l'état. Elle n'est jamais vérifiée au milieu de la résolution d'un sort. Vous mettrez l'Arcanis original dans votre main avant que la saison de tissage ne soit entièrement résolue. La règle de la légende n'entre pas en jeu pendant cette situation.\n\n    [hr]\n    [Q] If I cast [c]Righteous Confluence[/c] choosing mode two once to exile my opponent's [c]Leyline of Sanctity[/c] and mode three twice to gain 10 total life, and the opponent responds by [c]Boomerang[/c]ing the Leyline back to their hand, do I still gain 10 life?[/Q]\n\n[hr] [Q] Si je lance [c]Confluence juste[/c] en choisissant le mode deux une fois pour exiler la [c]Ligne de sainteté de mon adversaire[/c] et le mode trois deux fois pour gagner 10 points de vie, et que l'adversaire répond en [c]Boomerang[/c]en remettant la Leyline à sa main, est-ce que je gagne quand même 10 points de vie ?[/Q]\n\n    [A] You do not. Righteous Confluence had only one target, Leyline of Sanctity, and that target has disappeared. If a spell loses all of its targets by the time it goes to resolve, it fizzles and none of its effects happen. [/A]\n\n[A] Vous ne l'avez pas. Confluence Juste n'avait qu'une seule cible, Leyline of Sanctity, et cette cible a disparu.

Putting a land onto the battlefield with a spell or ability doesn't use up your one land drop per turn.[/A]\n\n[A] Vous pouvez toujours jouer à la Forêt.
